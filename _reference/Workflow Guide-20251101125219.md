## Key Deadlines (Don't Miss These!)

| Deadline | What | Consequence if Missed |
| ---| ---| --- |
| **Friday 7 PM** | Upload content via JotForm | Content delayed to next cycle |
| **Wednesday 5 PM** | Approve content in [Frame.io](http://Frame.io) | Auto-approved, publishes as-is |

* * *
## Your 3 Simple Responsibilities
### 1\. CAPTURE (Monday-Thursday)
Follow your capture assignments exactly:
*   Right person captures
*   Right day/time
*   Right content topic
### 2\. UPLOAD (Friday by 7 PM)
Use JotForm link to submit all weekly content
### 3\. REVIEW (Wednesday by 5 PM)
Check [Frame.io](http://Frame.io), leave feedback, request revisions if needed
**That's it. We handle everything else.**
* * *
## What We Handle
✅ All editing (color, sound, cuts)
✅ Caption writing
✅ Revisions
✅ Scheduling
✅ Publishing
✅ Performance tracking
✅ Platform optimization
* * *
## Revision Rights
**You get:**
*   1 content revision per video (editing changes)
*   1 caption revision per post (text changes)
**This means:** If you want changes to both the video AND caption, that's fine - but each gets one round of revisions.
**Why this policy?** It keeps content moving and prevents perfectionism paralysis. In 95% of cases, the first version is great.
* * *
## What If I Miss a Deadline?
**No drama.** Life happens.
**If you miss Friday upload:**
*   That content shifts to next cycle
*   We keep publishing the content you DID submit
*   Just get back on track next week
**If you miss Wednesday review:**
*   Content publishes as-is
*   You already saw it, so we assume it's approved
**If this becomes a pattern (3+ weeks):**
*   We'll have a quick call to adjust your schedule
*   Maybe you need different capture days/times
*   Or temporarily reduce to 1 post/week
* * *
## Questions About the Workflow?
**"What if I'm traveling Friday?"**
Upload Thursday night. The deadline is "by Friday 7 PM" not "on Friday."
**"Can I upload content early in the week?"**
Yes! Upload as soon as you capture it. Friday is the DEADLINE, not the requirement.
**"What if I forget my JotForm link?"**
It's in every confirmation email. Bookmark it the first time you use it.
**"How do I know what to capture each week?"**
Check your ClickUp Content calendar - every assignment has specific details.
**"What happens in** [**Frame.io**](http://Frame.io)**?"**
You'll get an email with a link. Click it, watch the video, leave comments if you want changes. Super simple.

## Remember: This is a SYSTEM, Not a Sprint
**Week 1-2:** Feels new and maybe awkward
**Week 3-4:** Starting to feel routine
**Week 5-6:** Fully in rhythm
**Week 8+:** Content quality and performance accelerating
**Consistency beats perfection.** Your job is to show up and capture. We'll make it look great.
