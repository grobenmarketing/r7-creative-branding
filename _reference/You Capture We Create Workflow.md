# ClickUp Structure
Each client has a dedicated folder containing two lists:
*   **Content List** – Where all content ideas and tasks are managed
*   **Uploads List** – Where JotForm submissions initially land
![](https://t9014171165.p.clickup-attachments.com/t9014171165/c044f42b-2075-450c-a029-86a89a6fea62/image.png)
**Key Custom Fields:**
*   Content Owner
*   Content Capture (Date & Time)
*   Location
*   Content Uploader (auto-populated from JotForm "Your Name" field)
*   Editor (dropdown)
*   Revision Requested (Yes/No dropdown)
* * *
# Process Stages & Statuses
## **Stage 1: IDEA**
**Status:** IDEA (Active)
During client meetings, we brainstorm content ideas such as:
*   Behind the scenes
*   Employee candid photos
*   Talking to customers
*   Employees discussing products or services
*   Other relevant content opportunities
**Actions:**
1. Create new tasks in the client's Content list
2. Add the content title
3. Include any relevant details in the task description
4. Assign a publication **due date** (this populates the calendar view)
![](https://t9014171165.p.clickup-attachments.com/t9014171165/9e52f545-3027-4e9e-862f-75db7f6ee9c1/image.png)
* * *
## **Stage 2: ASSIGNED**
**Status:** ASSIGNED (Active)
**Actions:**
1. Assign the content to a specific employee (Content Owner) at the client's company
2. Set the **Content Capture Date & Time** – when the employee will shoot the content
3. Add the **Location** – where the content will be captured (e.g., front desk, warehouse, job site)
4. Screenshot the assignments and send to all meeting participants for accountability

**Client Responsibility:**
The assigned employee must capture the photo or video content at the specified date, time, and location, then upload through our JotForm before Friday at 7 PM of that week. When they submit through JotForm, they'll enter their name in the "Your Name" field, which populates the **Content Uploader** field in ClickUp.
![](https://t9014171165.p.clickup-attachments.com/t9014171165/49985bcd-117f-405e-b31e-b7da774177b8/screencapture-form-jotform-252755033643153-2025-10-03-15_23_16.png)

## **Stage 3: UPLOADED**
**Status:** UPLOADED (Active)
**Timeline:** Review between Friday 7 PM and Monday before noon
### Merging Uploads with Content Items
Once a client has submitted files through JotForm and the submission appears in the "Uploads" list, follow these steps:
1. Open the upload item in the "Uploads" list
2. Click the three-dot menu icon
3. Select "Merge"
4. In the window that opens, search for and select the corresponding item in the "Content" list
5. Complete the merge
This process will remove the upload from the "Uploads" list and transfer all information and attachments to the associated item in the "Content" list within ClickUp.

**Important:** Per our agreement with clients, they receive one round of revisions only. We edit according to what was discussed in meetings to avoid surprises.

### [Frame.io](http://Frame.io) Status Management
[Frame.io](http://Frame.io) uses the following statuses to track content review:
*   **New** – Content just uploaded by editor
*   **Good to Go** – Approved, no changes needed
*   **Revision Requested** – Client has requested changes
*   **Revision Complete** – Revisions have been completed by editor
**Editor Workflow:**
Every time an editor uploads or updates content in [Frame.io](http://Frame.io), they must copy the [Frame.io](http://Frame.io) link and paste it as a comment in the corresponding ClickUp list item.
* * *
### Calendar & Accountability Tools
**During Meetings:**
*   Share screen showing both the Content list and calendar view
*   Review what's scheduled and what needs to be captured
**After Meetings:**
*   Screenshot the spreadsheet view showing: Content idea name, assigned Content Owner, capture location, capture date/time, and upload deadline
*   Send to all meeting participants
**JotForm Submission:**
*   Employee enters their name in "Your Name" field (becomes Content Uploader in ClickUp)
*   Uploads content files
*   Thank you page displays the Friday 7 PM upload deadline
*   Reminds them that late submissions cannot be included in the next week's workflow
**Think of it like a newspaper:** Classified ads have a deadline to appear in Wednesday's print edition. Same principle—if content isn't submitted on time, it gets pushed to the next cycle.
