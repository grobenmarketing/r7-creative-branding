**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Meeting Type:** Value Realization Checkpoint
**When:** 2 weeks after first content publishes
* * *
## Purpose

* * *
## Before This Meeting
### Your Prep:
*   Pull performance metrics from all platforms (views, engagement, reach)
*   Review upload compliance (did they hit deadlines?)
*   Review [Frame.io](http://Frame.io) feedback patterns (responsive? confused?)
*   Note any content that over/under-performed
*   Identify 2-3 quick wins to celebrate
### Client Prep:
*   None required (but let them know you'll review performance together)
* * *
## Meeting Agenda
### 1\. Celebrate Quick Wins (5 min)
**Share specific wins:**
*   "Your video about X got 847 views - that's 3x your previous average"
*   "You've published 6 pieces on schedule - that's consistency your competitors don't have"
*   "Your Google Business rating went from 4.2 to 4.6"
**Why this matters:** Early momentum recognition reduces churn risk.
* * *
### 2\. Performance Review (10 min)
**Show metrics:**

| Platform | Posts Published | Total Views | Engagement | Top Performer |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

**Discuss:**
*   What's working (content types, topics, formats)
*   What's underperforming (and why)
*   Patterns in audience response
* * *
### 3\. Process Check-In (8 min)
**Ask:**
*   "How's the upload process working for you?"
*   "Is the Friday 7 PM deadline realistic, or should we adjust?"
*   "Any confusion in [Frame.io](http://Frame.io) reviews?"
*   "Is your Content Owner comfortable capturing content?"
**Listen for:**
*   Technical blockers
*   Time/resource constraints
*   Confusion about workflow
*   Team resistance
**Address issues immediately** - don't let small friction become churn risk.
* * *
### 4\. Strategy Adjustments (5 min)
**Based on performance:**
*   Should we shift content focus? (more of what works, less of what doesn't)
*   Do we need to adjust upload frequency?
*   Are there new content opportunities based on what's resonating?
**Make 1-2 specific adjustments max** - too many changes confuse execution.
* * *
### 5\. Next 30 Days (2 min)
**Confirm:**
*   Content calendar for next 3 weeks
*   Any upcoming events/promotions to build content around
*   Next Bi-Weekly Sync date
* * *
