## Core Positioning

**R7 Creative: We Keep You in the 4-Minute Decision**

We transform invisible local service businesses into visible, lead-generating machines by managing your digital pulse during the critical 4-minute window when urgent customers decide who to call. While competitors focus on generic social media management, we ensure you survive the browser tab test with recent, authentic proof of active work—turning invisible losses into phone calls.

---

## The Market Reality

Every day, thousands of potential customers face an urgent problem and spend exactly 4 minutes deciding who to call. They open 5 businesses on Google Maps, check social media for signs of life, and eliminate 3 based on dead profiles. Only 2 businesses get the callback. **80% of businesses fail this test daily and never even know it happened.**

### The Customer Journey (The "John Story")

> **See also:** [[../_reference/The John Story-20251101125003|The John Story]] for complete narrative

**Act 1: The Trigger (30 seconds)**
- Boss drops urgent problem on John's desk
- Needs solution provider NOW
- 4 minutes until lunch to figure this out

**Act 2: The Search (2 minutes)**
- Google search → Maps results
- Opens 5 businesses with 50+ reviews
- Control-clicks through tabs rapidly

**Act 3: The Elimination (90 seconds)**
- Checks social profiles for signs of life
- Dead profiles = closed browser tabs
- Active profiles = worth investigating

**Act 4: The Decision (30 seconds)**
- Down to 2 businesses that "feel right"
- These get the callback after lunch
- The other 3? They never knew John existed

## Our Unique Philosophy

### 1. We Don't "Manage Social Media"—We Manage Your Digital Pulse

During critical decision moments through our proprietary **"You Capture, We Create"** system, we ensure:
- Recent proof of active work
- Authentic team and process visibility
- Consistent presence across all 3 platforms customers check

> **See:** [[02-unique-value-proposition|Unique Value Proposition]] for complete system details

### 2. Everything Flows from Your Brand Pillars

Most agencies skip strategy or charge $2,000-$2,500 extra. We create a complete 6-part **Brand Pillars & Marketing Position document** for free as part of onboarding. Everything flows from this:
- Content strategy
- Optimization priorities
- Posting calendar
- Messaging consistency

**No guesswork. Just systematic execution.**

### 3. Alignment Across the 4-Minute Decision Window

We create alignment across **Google Business Profile → Social Media → Website** so customers see consistent proof you're:
- Active (not dead/closed)
- Available (not too busy)
- Legitimate (real people, real work)

### 4. We Optimize for Decision-Making, Not Vanity Metrics

We don't chase:
- Follower counts
- Like numbers
- Engagement rates
- Impressions

We optimize for:
- **Phone calls** from qualified leads
- **Email inquiries** from ready-to-buy customers
- **Calendar bookings** that convert
- **Revenue growth** that's measurable

## What We Reject

We are **not** for everyone. We deliberately reject:

### ❌ One-Off Tactics and Fragmented Work
We don't do:
- "Just post to social for me"
- "Just optimize my Google profile"
- One-time projects without ongoing management

We create complete, integrated systems that work because everything reinforces everything else.

### ❌ Businesses Not Ready to Shift Habits
Our system requires clients to:
- Capture 10-15% of content (photos/videos on phone)
- Attend bi-weekly 20-minute strategy calls
- Upload content by Friday 7 PM deadlines
- Review and approve content by Wednesday 5 PM

If you're not ready to shift these habits, we're not the right fit.

### ❌ Being the Cheapest Option
We're not competing on price. At $550-$950/month, we're:
- More expensive than freelancers on Fiverr
- Less expensive than full-service agencies ($3K-$10K/month)
- Priced at the "value sweet spot" for proven ROI

**We're the option that actually works because it's systematic.**

### ❌ Violating Platform Guidelines for "Fancy" Content
Google Business Profile has strict rules:
- No fancy transitions or motion effects in videos
- No text overlays on photos (unless describing the business location)
- Content must be authentic and representative of actual operations

**We follow these rules** because violating them risks account penalties or removal.

- **Team Size:** 5-20 employees (sweet spot: 8 employees)

### Current Situation

- **Readiness:** Have the time, money, and urgency to invest in a proven system

### Industries
Service businesses where customers search online before calling:
- HVAC & Plumbing
- Electrical & Contractors

## Competitive Position

### What We're REALLY Competing Against

You're **not** competing against other marketing agencies.

You're competing against:

1. **Previous Failed Attempts**
   - DIY social media (gave up after 3 weeks)
   - Cheap freelancers (no strategy, no results)
   - Expensive agencies (thousands spent, no ROI)

2. **Skepticism About Effectiveness**
   - "My customers don't use social media"
   - "I get business without social media"
   - "This doesn't work for my industry"
   - "I tried this before and it didn't work"

3. **Scattered Approaches**
   - Different freelancer for social
   - Different person for Google Business
   - Different agency for website
   - No integration = no results

4. **Deeply Entrenched Beliefs**
   - "Online marketing is overhyped"
   - "This stuff doesn't work"
   - "I don't have time for this"
   - "Marketing is too expensive"

### How We Win

**We prove them wrong in the first 30 days with a free trial.**

Month 1: First "I found you on Google" call
Month 2-3: 1-2 calls/month → 3-4 calls/week
Month 6+: Loyal long-term client because we proved what no one else could
