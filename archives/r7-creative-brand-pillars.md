# Brand Pillars for R7 Creative
**Human Touch Marketing in an AI & Automated World**

---

## 1. BRAND POSITIONING STATEMENT

**R7 Creative: We Keep You in the 4-Minute Decision**

We transform invisible local service businesses into visible, lead-generating machines by managing your digital pulse during the critical 4-minute window when urgent customers decide who to call. While competitors focus on generic social media management, we ensure you survive the browser tab test with recent, authentic proof of active work—turning invisible losses into phone calls.

**The Market Reality:**
Every day, thousands of potential customers face an urgent problem and spend exactly 4 minutes deciding who to call. They open 5 businesses on Google Maps, check social media for signs of life, and eliminate 3 based on dead profiles. Only 2 businesses get the callback. 80% of businesses fail this test daily and never even know it happened.

**Our Unique Philosophy:**
- **We don't "manage social media"—we manage your digital pulse** during critical decision moments through our proprietary "You Capture, We Create" system
- Everything flows from your custom Brand Pillars & Marketing Position (6-part copywriting document worth $2,000-$2,500, included free)
- We create alignment across Google Business Profile, social media, and website so customers see consistent proof you're active, available, and legitimate
- We optimize for the customer's 4-minute decision process—not vanity metrics like followers or likes

**What We Reject:**
- One-off tactics and fragmented freelance work
- Businesses that aren't ready to shift habits and capture 10-15% of content
- Being the cheapest option (we're the option that actually works because it's systematic)
- Violating platform guidelines for fancy graphics (we follow Google's authenticity rules)

**Who We Serve Best:**
Local service businesses with $2-10M annual revenue, 5-20 employees, profitable but plateaued at 1-2 calls/month, finally recognizing that being invisible online is costing them $20-50K+ quarterly in lost opportunities. They have the time, money, and urgency to invest $550-$950/month in a proven system.

**Competitive Position:**
You're not competing against other marketing agencies—you're competing against clients' previous failed attempts, skepticism about online marketing's effectiveness, scattered approaches across multiple vendors, and the deeply entrenched belief that "this stuff doesn't work." You prove them wrong in the first 30 days with a free trial.

*This positioning is based on your clear statement: "I really help businesses that are invisible, become visible" and your integrated process (Google → Reviews → Website → Social as one system). The 4-Minute Decision framework captures the urgency and psychology of how customers actually choose service providers in 2025.*

---

**What Makes This Different:**

**1. The Brand Pillars Foundation**
Most agencies skip strategy or charge $2,000+ extra. We create a complete 6-part Brand Pillars & Marketing Position document for free as part of onboarding. Everything flows from this—content strategy, optimization, posting calendar—so there's no guesswork. This is the secret weapon that makes everything else work better.

**2. The "You Capture, We Create" System**
- **You do 10-15%:** Capture authentic content on your phone (photos/videos of your team, process, work)
- **We do 85-90%:** Strategy, editing, captions, scheduling, review management, engagement, optimization
- **Why it works:** Authentic, raw content builds trust faster than polished corporate marketing. Customers want to see real people doing real work.

**3. The Complete Integrated Approach**
We don't handle "just social" or "just SEO"—we create an entire system involving:
- Copywriting & content strategy
- Project management & workflow
- Video editing & photo curation
- Social media management & posting
- Weekly engagement coaching
- Google Business Profile & website optimization
- Review management & response

**Everything works together** so customers see you consistently across the 3 platforms they check in 4 minutes: Google Business Profile → Social Media → Website

**4. Results You Can Measure:**
- **25-50% more phone calls**
- **35-70% more website clicks**
- **15-30% less price resistance** to quotes
- **2.7x more trustworthy** perception from customers

*Typical results from our client base. Individual outcomes vary based on industry, competition, and market conditions.*

**5. The "Aha Moment":**
Clients don't realize until their phone starts ringing that these searches were happening all along—100 people monthly searching for their business in their area, but they were invisible so those calls were going to competitors. When the first customer calls in week 2-4 and says "I found you on Google," everything clicks.

**6. Speed to Results:**
Within 2-3 months, clients go from 1-2 calls/month to 3-4 calls/week. One client went from worried about calendar bookings past 3-6 weeks to hiring 3 more staff members in 8 months. Another moved from completely unconvinced about social media ROI to consistently getting high-ticket jobs from online visibility.

**7. The 30-Day Free Trial:**
We remove all risk. Try it free for 30 days. See the phone start ringing. On day 23, you get an invoice. Pay it and continue, or politely decline and part ways on good terms. Most clients who see results in months 1-3 become loyal long-term partners because we proved what no one else could.

*This draws from your detailed walkthrough of your integrated process (Google Business → Reviews → Website → Social), your story about the client who "wasn't sure if posting on Google and social would do anything" and then went 1-2 calls/month to 3-4 calls/week, and your clear statement: "the difference between me and a competitor is, I actually create an entire system that involves multiple disciplines...I do it all in order to get the result."*

## 3. TARGET MARKET DEFINITION

**Primary Target: Local Service Businesses (5-50 Employees)**

**Financial Profile:**
- **Annual Revenue:** $2-10M (sweet spot: $3M)
- **Team Size:** 5-20 employees (sweet spot: 8 employees)
- **Monthly Marketing Budget:** Able to invest $550-$950/month
- **Business Stage:** Profitable but plateaued—established track record, stable operations, but struggling to grow

**Current Situation:**
- **Lead Flow:** Stuck at 1-2 calls/month when they should be getting 3-4 calls/week
- **Calendar Status:** Booking only 2-3 weeks out (not 2-3 months out like they want)
- **Visibility:** Pretty invisible when it comes to being online—dead social profiles, incomplete Google Business Profile, outdated website
- **Urgency:** "Day late and a dollar short"—hurting on money each week, realizing them not having enough business is catching up with them

**The Trigger Moment:**
What makes them realize they need you:
1. Conversations with staff/board members: "We need to get better at this online thing"
2. Google searching their own business and realizing they're nowhere to be found
3. Seeing competitors show up instead of them
4. Wondering why the phone isn't ringing despite quality work
5. Worried about not having work booked past 3-6 weeks

**What They've Already Tried (and Failed):**
- Hired a sales guy (didn't work)
- Sent out email blasts (minimal response)
- Asked for referrals (inconsistent and slow)
- Tried to improve word-of-mouth (unreliable)
- Maybe hired different marketing agencies or freelancers for different things (fragmented, no results)
- DIY social media posting (gave up after a few weeks)

**Industries That Fit:**
Service businesses where customers search online before calling:
- HVAC & Plumbing
- Electrical & Contractors
- Roofing & Home Services
- Commercial Services (cleaning, maintenance, etc.)
- Specialty Trades
- B2B Service Providers

**Psychographic Profile:**

**What They Value:**
1. **Time:** In a frenzy managing day-to-day operations—can't add more to their plate
2. **Certainty:** Want proof this will work before investing (that's why the 30-day trial is crucial)
3. **Simplicity:** Don't want to learn marketing—want someone to handle it systematically
4. **Results:** More phone calls, more revenue, calendars booked full

**Emotional Drivers:**
- **Fear:** Missing opportunities they don't even know about (the invisible Johns)
- **Frustration:** Wondering why phone isn't ringing despite quality work
- **Urgency:** Need consistent lead flow to maintain operations and grow
- **Skepticism:** Burned by marketing agencies promising "brand awareness" with no ROI

**What They're Really Looking For:**
- Someone who has the time and the money and sees this is something they absolutely need
- Someone who has talked with their staff or board and decided "we know we need somebody to do this, and we're willing to pay for it"
- Someone willing to change their habits (capture content weekly, attend bi-weekly meetings)
- Someone who understands this is an investment that pays back in 2-3 months

**The Decision Factor:**
They're willing to take a risk on something new, but they need to see proof it works before committing long-term. That's why the 30-day free trial is so effective—it removes all risk from their decision. They see results in months 1-3 (phone ringing, emails coming in) and become loyal long-term clients.

**What Disqualifies Them:**
- Can't afford $550-950/month
- Don't have anyone on staff who can capture content (no time, won't shift habits)
- Expect instant results or overnight miracles
- Want full-service video production with fancy transitions (we follow platform guidelines for authenticity)
- Not willing to participate in bi-weekly strategy calls
- Looking for the cheapest option, not the option that works

*This is built from your answer to Q3: clients are "operating at a pretty good level but they're kind of swamped in weeds" and "they're invisible when it comes to being online." Your statement that your ideal client "has the time and the money and sees that this is something they absolutely need" and your emphasis on $3M revenue with 8 employees as your best client type.*

## 4. PROBLEM SOLVED STATEMENT

**The Core Problem: The 4-Minute Elimination**

Local service businesses are losing $20-50K+ quarterly because they're being eliminated in 4 minutes by customers they never even knew existed. Every day, potential customers ("Johns") spend exactly 4 minutes deciding who to call. They open 5 businesses on Google Maps, check social media for signs of life, eliminate 3 based on dead profiles, and call only 2. **80% of businesses fail this test daily and never know it happened.**

**The Invisible Crisis:**

**Problem 1: The Lost Opportunities**
- If 100 people monthly search for their service in their area with only 4 local competitors, they should get 25+ calls per month
- But if they're invisible (dead social, incomplete Google profile, outdated website), they might get only 1-2 calls/month
- That's 23+ lost calls monthly = 276+ lost calls annually
- At average job sizes for service businesses: **$50K-$300K in lost revenue annually**
- **The worst part:** They'll never know John looked. No missed call. No "we went with someone else" email. Just wondering why the phone isn't ringing.

**Problem 2: The Trust Deficit Tax**
- 81% of customers research businesses online before buying
- 20-30% of potential customers choose competitors not because of price or quality, but because inconsistent digital presence makes you look "out of business" or "too busy/inattentive"
- Dead social profiles signal unreliable operations
- Every quarter of inconsistency costs service businesses $20-50K in deals they didn't even know they lost

**Problem 3: The Cascading Death Spiral**
Without systematic visibility, businesses:
1. Plateau at 1-2 calls/month (can't book calendars past 2-3 weeks)
2. Can't grow or hire staff
3. Stay busy but not profitable
4. Get more frustrated and convinced "online marketing doesn't work"
5. Have even less money and time to invest in fixing it
6. Fall further behind competitors who ARE visible
7. Eventually become desperate or go out of business

**Problem 4: The Skepticism Trap**
Because they've tried marketing before and it didn't work (fragmented freelancers, DIY social that fizzled out, expensive agencies with no ROI), they're now convinced:
- "My customers don't use social media" (wrong—they check if you're still in business)
- "I get business without social media" (only the customers who call without checking—not the Johns)
- "This stuff doesn't work for my industry" (it works for trust-building, not direct selling)
- "I don't have time for this" (exactly why John eliminated you)

---

**What Actually Happens When It's Solved:**

**Immediate Impact (Weeks 2-4):**
- First customer calls and says "I found you on Google"
- Client has the "aha moment"—realizes these searches were happening all along
- Phone starts ringing with qualified leads (people already searching for their service)

**Short-Term Impact (Months 2-3):**
- Go from 1-2 calls/month to 3-4 calls/week
- Calendar books out 4-6 weeks instead of 2-3 weeks
- Less price resistance to quotes (customers already trust you from online research)
- More confident in business operations

**Long-Term Impact (Months 6-12):**
- Calendar books out 2-3 months in advance
- Hire more staff to handle growth (one client hired 3 people in 8 months)
- Consistent, reliable lead source (not dependent on referrals or word-of-mouth luck)
- More money as business owners—able to do the things they want
- Relief knowing where next week's/month's leads are coming from

**The Emotional Relief:**
You're not just solving "we need more leads." You're solving the deeper, entrenched problem: **"We've been struggling with this for years and nothing we've tried has worked, so we've basically given up."** When it works in the first 30 days, the relief is profound. They finally have proof that this stuff actually works—they just needed someone to do it systematically and correctly.

*This comes from your Q5 answer about the cost of invisibility: "100 people a month searching for their business...they're not even being considered...the lost opportunity is immeasurable." Your example of the client going from 1-2 calls/month to 3-4 calls/week demonstrates the specific transformation. Your statement that they "should have spent the money...ago but they didn't" and now "them not having enough business is catching up with them" shows the urgency and cost.*

## 5. CUSTOMER AVATAR SUMMARY

**Meet Marcus: The Invisible Service Business Owner**

**Demographics:**
- **Business:** Regional HVAC, plumbing, electrical, or home services company
- **Revenue:** $2-3M annually (profitable but plateaued)
- **Team:** 8 employees (wants to hire more but can't justify it yet)
- **Age:** 40-55 years old
- **Role:** Owner/Operator (wears many hats)
- **Location:** Mid-sized city or suburban area with 3-5 local competitors

**Current Business Situation:**

**The Daily Reality:**
- Calendar books out only 2-3 weeks at a time (keeps him up at night)
- Getting 1-2 calls/month when he should get 3-4 calls/week
- In a frenzy managing day-to-day operations—barely has time to breathe
- "Day late and a dollar short"—hurting on money each week
- Knows he needs to grow but doesn't have time or capital to figure it out

**What He's Already Tried (and Failed):**
- ✗ Hired a sales guy (didn't generate enough leads, eventually let him go)
- ✗ Sent out email blasts (minimal response, felt spammy)
- ✗ Asked for referrals (inconsistent, slow, uncomfortable)
- ✗ Relied on word-of-mouth (unreliable, can't scale)
- ✗ Tried DIY social media posting (gave up after 3 weeks)
- ✗ Maybe hired a freelancer or cheap marketing agency (no results, stopped after 3 months)

**The Visibility Check:**
When he Googles his own business:
- Finds himself buried on page 2-3 of results
- Or doesn't show up at all
- Sees competitors showing up instead
- Google Business Profile incomplete (last post 8 months ago)
- Social media profiles dead (last activity from 2022)
- Website outdated and generic

**The Frustrations:**

**Surface Frustrations:**
- "I don't have time to do social media"
- "I'm not sure posting online will do anything for us"
- "Marketing is expensive—probably costs thousands"
- "I'm too busy running the business to create content"

**Deeper Fears:**
- Terrified that his business isn't growing because something's wrong with his service (not because he's invisible)
- Worried that investing in marketing is throwing good money after bad
- Convinced by past failures that "online marketing is overhyped" or "doesn't work for my industry"
- Doesn't want to admit he needs help (pride issue)
- Fears his competitors are figuring this out while he falls further behind

**The Trigger Moment:**

**What Finally Makes Him Act:**
1. Staff/board member says: "We need to get better at this online thing"
2. Customer mentions: "I almost didn't call you—your Google profile looked dead"
3. Loses a big job to a competitor who "looked more professional online"
4. Realizes calendar is booking only 2 weeks out (danger zone)
5. Does a late-night Google search and sees competitors everywhere, him nowhere

**The Turning Point:**
He finally realizes: **"I should have spent the money and took the time to fix this years ago, but I didn't. Now, me not having enough business is catching up with me, and I have even less money and less time to invest in it."**

---

**What Will Move Him:**

**Stage 1: Getting His Attention (First Call)**
- Show him the invisible loss: "100 people monthly search for your service in your area. If you're not showing up, those calls go to your 3-4 competitors. That's $50K+ you're losing annually."
- Address skepticism: "You've tried marketing before and it didn't work. I get it. That's why we offer a 30-day free trial—so you can see it working before you invest a dollar."
- Simplify the commitment: "You capture content 10-20 minutes/week. We handle the other 85-90%. All we need is a 20-minute call every two weeks."

**Stage 2: Proof (Month 1)**
When the first customer calls and says "I found you on Google," everything shifts. He has the "aha moment"—realizes these searches were happening all along, but they were going to competitors because he was invisible.

**Stage 3: Relief (Months 2-3)**
- Calendar starts booking 4-6 weeks out (instead of 2-3)
- Going from 1-2 calls/month to 3-4 calls/week
- Less price resistance to quotes
- Finally has a reliable, systematic source of leads that doesn't depend on him remembering to ask for referrals

**Stage 4: Loyalty (Months 4-12)**
He becomes a loyal, long-term client because you've proven what no one else could. He's now the advocate telling other business owners: "You need to do this—it actually works."

---

**What Success Looks Like to Marcus:**

**Short-Term Wins (90 Days):**
- ✓ Phone ringing with qualified leads
- ✓ Calendar booking 4-6 weeks out (not just 2-3)
- ✓ Less anxiety about "where are next week's leads coming from?"
- ✓ Proof this investment pays back (sees ROI within 2-3 months)

**Long-Term Vision (6-12 Months):**
- ✓ Calendar booked 2-3 months out consistently
- ✓ Hiring 1-3 more staff members to handle growth
- ✓ Revenue increasing 25-50% from new lead flow
- ✓ Not lying awake worrying about business survival
- ✓ Feeling in control of business growth (not at mercy of word-of-mouth luck)
- ✓ More money and freedom to enjoy life outside work

**The Emotional Payoff:**
Relief. Confidence. Control. Pride. Finally feeling like he's winning instead of just surviving.

---

**How to Talk to Marcus:**

**What Resonates:**
- "Your customers are searching for you right now—are they finding you or your competitors?"
- "This isn't expensive or complicated. It's $550-950/month and pays for itself in 2-3 months."
- "Try it free for 30 days. See the phone start ringing. Then decide."
- "You don't need to be perfect—just more present than the guy down the street."

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Corporate marketing speak or jargon
- Talking about followers, likes, or vanity metrics
- Promising overnight results
- Adding complexity to his already busy life
- Being the "cheapest" option (he's been burned by cheap before)

*This is built from your description of your best client (8 employees, $3M revenue, can afford $1K/month), the client story of the person worried about calendar bookings past 3-6 weeks, and your statement: "a lot of them usually are pretty urgent to solve this because they're hurting on money each week...they've already tried absolutely everything they can within their realm of expertise."*

## 6. MESSAGING FRAMEWORK

**Core Message:**

**"We Keep You in the 4-Minute Decision"**

Your next customer will decide on you in 4 minutes. Not because of your quality, experience, or price—but because you looked active when they checked. We manage your digital pulse during those critical 4 minutes, ensuring you're one of the 2 businesses that get called instead of one of the 3 that get eliminated in browser tabs.

---

### Primary Value Propositions (Use These Everywhere):

**For the Skeptical:**
"You don't need to be perfect. Just more present than the guy down the street."

**For the Urgent:**
"Right now, someone like John is deciding whether to call you or your competitor. Are you passing his 4-minute test?"

**For the ROI-Focused:**
"Every quarter of inconsistency costs service businesses $20-50K in lost deals they never knew existed."

**For the Time-Crunched:**
"You capture 10-15%. We handle 85-90%. Your only commitment: 20 minutes every two weeks."

**For the Overwhelmed:**
"This isn't complicated or expensive. It's $550-950/month and pays for itself in 2-3 months."

---

### Key Messages to Emphasize (Pull These Into Everything):

**1. The Invisible Loss (The Problem)**
- "100 people monthly might be searching for your service in your area. If you're not showing up, those calls are going to your 3-4 competitors. That's $50K+ in lost revenue annually—more than our entire annual investment."
- "80% of businesses fail the 4-minute test daily and never even know it happened. No missed call. No 'we went with someone else' email. Just wondering why the phone isn't ringing."
- "You'll never know John looked. He opened your profile, saw dead social media, and closed the tab. He called someone else. You never knew he existed."

**2. The 4-Minute Decision Window (The Framework)**
- "When someone needs your service RIGHT NOW, they spend 4 minutes deciding who to call. They open 5 businesses, eliminate 3 based on dead social profiles, and call 2."
- "Customers check three platforms in 4 minutes before deciding who to call: Google Business Profile → Social Media → Website. We make sure you pass the test on all three."
- "Active social media is the fastest way customers assess if you're worth their time. Dead profiles = dead to them."

**3. The Simple Solution (What We Do)**
- "We don't 'manage social media'—we manage your digital pulse during critical decision moments."
- "This works because we give Google what Google wants (complete profiles, reviews, authentic content), give customers what they want (proof you're active and legitimate), and give you what you want (phone calls from people already searching)."
- "Everything flows from your custom Brand Pillars document ($2,000-$2,500 value, included free). No guesswork. Just systematic execution."

**4. The Proof (Results They Can Expect)**
- "You'll see results faster than you think—often within 30 days. First customer calls and says 'I found you on Google.' That's when you know this works."
- "Within 2-3 months, clients go from 1-2 calls/month to 3-4 calls/week. One client hired 3 more staff in 8 months because of the leads we generated."
- **Measurable results:** 25-50% more phone calls, 35-70% more website clicks, 15-30% less price resistance, 2.7x more trustworthy perception

**5. The Risk-Removal (30-Day Free Trial)**
- "Try it free for 30 days. See the phone start ringing. On day 23, you get an invoice. Pay it and continue, or politely decline. No hard feelings."
- "We remove all risk. Most clients who see results in months 1-3 become loyal long-term partners because we proved what no one else could."

**6. The Partnership (How Easy This Is)**
- "You do 10-15%: capture content on your phone (10-20 min/week). We do 85-90%: strategy, editing, captions, scheduling, review management, engagement, optimization."
- "We handle the heavy lifting. Your only commitment: a 20-minute call every two weeks to plan content."
- "This isn't 'marketing'—it's Results as a Service. You pay for the outcome: more qualified phone calls, higher close rates, more revenue."

### Tone & Voice Characteristics:

**Confident but not pushy:**
You speak from experience without lecturing. You explain why things matter without talking down to them. You know this works because you've seen it work repeatedly. You use phrases like "Here's what I've found..." and "The reality is..." not "You need to..." or "You should..."

**Practical and no-BS:**
You cut through the noise of marketing hype. You're honest about what works and what doesn't. You acknowledge their skepticism because you've heard it a thousand times and proven it wrong a thousand times. You don't oversell; you show proof.

**Education-focused:**
Your goal is helping them understand where their business actually is (invisible, losing leads) vs. where it could be (visible, flooded with leads). You're not trying to convince them to buy marketing; you're trying to help them see what they're already losing.

**Service-oriented:**
You talk about working *with* them, not *for* them. You acknowledge that most business owners are in a frenzy and can't add more to their plate—so you make it easy. You're solving the real friction (time and complexity), not asking them to solve it themselves.

**Human and authentic:**
This is "Human Touch Marketing in an AI & Automated World." You emphasize authentic, raw content over polished corporate marketing because that's what builds trust faster. You're approachable, practical, and real.

---

### What to Avoid:

- ❌ Corporate marketing speak ("leverage synergies," "growth hacking," "maximize your brand potential")
- ❌ Vague promises ("We'll help you grow" without specifics)
- ❌ Talking about yourself instead of their results (focus on their phone ringing, not your process details)
- ❌ Treating them as if they're dumb or need convincing (they know they need this; they're just scared)
- ❌ Vanity metrics (followers, likes, impressions don't matter—phone calls do)
- ❌ Overpromising or hype (let the results speak)

---

### Objection Handling Using the 4-Minute Decision Framework:

**"My customers don't use social media"**
→ "John wasn't 'using social media'—he was checking if you're still in business. Big difference. 81% of customers research businesses online before buying. They're checking for a pulse, not engaging with content."

**"I get business without social media"**
→ "You get the customers who call without checking. What about the Johns who eliminate you in browser tabs? That's 20-30% of potential customers choosing competitors—not because of price or quality, but because you looked inactive."

**"Social media doesn't work for my industry"**
→ "John doesn't care about your industry. He cares that you look attentive and available when he needs you. This isn't about selling on social—it's about passing the trust check so they call you."

**"I don't have time for social media"**
→ "That's exactly why John eliminated you. You're proving his point about being too busy or inattentive. That's why our system works—you do 10-15%, we do 85-90%. You're not 'doing social media'; you're capturing 10-20 minutes of content weekly. We handle the rest."

**"This is too expensive"**
→ "It's $550-950/month. If 100 people monthly search for your service and you're invisible, you're losing $50K+ annually in calls that go to competitors. Our annual investment is $6,600-$11,400. The cost of invisibility is 5-10x higher. Plus, it pays for itself in 2-3 months."

**"I'm not sure this will work for me"**
→ "That's exactly why we offer a 30-day free trial. Don't take my word for it—see for yourself. Try it free for 30 days. If it works, you'll know. If it doesn't, you owe nothing. Most clients see the first call in weeks 2-4."

**"I tried marketing before and it didn't work"**
→ "I hear that a lot. Most businesses tried DIY social (gave up after 3 weeks), hired cheap freelancers (no strategy, no results), or worked with agencies that charged thousands with no ROI. That's why you're skeptical. The difference: we create a complete system with your Brand Pillars as the foundation. Everything flows from strategy. And we prove it works in 30 days—free."

---

### Channel-Specific Messaging Guidance:

**Social Media Posts (Your Own Channels):**

**Content Style:**
- Lead with the problem or invisible loss ("100 people searching for you monthly... are they finding you?")
- Use the "John Story" framework to illustrate the 4-minute decision
- Show before/after of visibility (what Google looked like before vs. now)

**Discovery/Sales Conversations:**

**Opening (First 2 Minutes):**
- "I'd like to ask you something. In the last month, how many people do you think looked at your business online but never called? Because I can tell you—it's probably 5-10x more than you think, and there's a very specific reason why they chose your competitor instead."

**Diagnostic Questions:**
- "When was the last time you posted evidence of current work?"
- "If someone Googled you right now, would they see recent activity?"
- "Are you losing jobs to competitors who aren't necessarily better, just more visible?"
- "How's your calendar looking 4-6 weeks out?"
- "What have you tried before for marketing, and why did it stop?"

**Education (Show the Invisible Loss):**
- Pull up their Google Business Profile and social media live on the call
- Show them what customers see (dead profiles, outdated posts)
- Walk through the 4-minute decision process: "Here's what John does..."
- Show them the math: "100 searches/month × 4 competitors = 25 calls you should be getting. But you're getting 1-2. That's $50K+ lost annually."

**Solution Presentation:**
- "Based on what you've told me, you're losing the 4-minute decision to competitors who simply show up more consistently. The good news? This is fixable."
- Explain "You Capture, We Create" (10-15% them, 85-90% you)
- Walk through the Brand Pillars foundation
- Show timeline: Month 1 (first call), Month 2-3 (3-4 calls/week), Month 6+ (calendar booked out)

**The Close:**
- "Here's what I recommend: Let's test this for 30 days—free. You'll see the phone start ringing. You'll get your first 'I found you on Google' call. Then you decide if this is worth continuing. Sound fair?"
- "On day 23, you'll get an invoice for $550 (or $950). If you want to continue, pay it. If not, just reply and we part ways on good terms. No risk to you."

**Handling Resistance:**
- If they hesitate: "What's your biggest concern about trying this?"
- If time is the issue: "That's exactly why this works—you do 10-20 min/week, we do everything else."
- If skepticism is the issue: "You've been burned before. I get it. That's why I'm not asking you to trust me—I'm asking you to test it for free for 30 days. Let the results speak."

### Elevator Pitches by Time Constraint:

**10-Second Version:**
"We help service businesses show up as trusted companies online so they get more people asking for quotes and saying yes faster."

**30-Second Version:**
"When someone needs your service RIGHT NOW, they spend 4 minutes deciding who to call. They open 5 businesses, eliminate 3 based on dead social profiles, and call 2. We make sure you're in the final 2 through our 'You Capture, We Create' system."

**60-Second Version:**
"Picture this: John's boss just dropped an urgent problem on his desk. He's got 4 minutes until lunch to find someone who can help. He opens 5 businesses on Google Maps, checks their social media, and eliminates everyone who looks inactive. Only 2 businesses make the cut. The other 3? They never even knew John existed. We make sure you're one of the 2 who get the call by managing your digital pulse—keeping your Google Business, social media, and website active with authentic proof of work. It's $550-950/month, you do 10-20 min/week capturing content, we handle the rest. Try it free for 30 days."
