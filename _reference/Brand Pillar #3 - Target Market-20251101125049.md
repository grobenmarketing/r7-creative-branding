Brand Pillar #3 - Target Market
_Defining Who R7 Creative Serves_

* * *

### **1\. Introduction**
R7 Creative’s **Target Market** is **small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) who know they** **_should_** **be active on social media but aren’t** — and feel the mounting pressure of missed opportunities. These businesses:
*   **Acknowledge the need** for social media but lack time, strategy, or confidence to execute.
*   **Fear losing customers** to competitors with polished, consistent online presences.
*   **Feel embarrassed** by outdated profiles or amateurish content.
**R7’s Role**: We turn their anxiety into action by positioning social media as a non-negotiable business asset — and delivering a turnkey solution to **“flip the lights on”** for their digital storefront.

* * *

### **2\. Demographics**
_Who are they?_
*   **Business Size**:
    *   Solopreneurs, startups, and SMBs (**1–20 employees**).
    *   **Industries**: Local retail, professional services (coaches, consultants, therapists), hospitality, healthcare, contractors, e-commerce.
*   **Revenue**:
    *   Annual revenue of **50k–2M**.
*   **Decision-Makers**:
    *   Business owners or managers aged **28–55** who wear multiple hats.
    *   Overwhelmed by day-to-day operations and skeptical of vague marketing promises.

* * *

### **3\. Psychographics**
_Why they’re stuck — and why they need R7_
*   **Values**: Growth, authenticity, simplicity, **measurable ROI**.
*   **Pain Points**:
    *   **Guilt**: _“I know I need to post, but I don’t know where to start.”_
    *   **Fear**: _“What if I invest time/money and get nothing in return?”_
    *   **Frustration**: _“I’ve tried agencies before — pretty posts, zero leads.”_
    *   **Paralysis**: Past failures with DIY content or generic agencies lead to inaction.
*   **Goals**:
    *   Post consistently without burnout.
    *   Replace “cringe” content with polished, authentic posts.
    *   **Prove** social media drives leads (not just vanity metrics).

* * *

### **4\. The Cost of Inaction**
_(What happens if they don’t act?)_
*   **Lost Revenue**: 80% of customers research businesses online first. Silence = lost sales.
*   **Reputation Damage**: Inconsistent or poor content makes them look unprofessional or uncaring.
    *   _Analogize_: A dirty, disorganized retail store or restaurant with no staff.
*   **Competitor Advantage**: Rivals with active social media steal their ideal clients.
**Example**:
_A local bakery stopped posting for 6 months. Customers assumed they closed, and a competitor gained 30% of their foot traffic._

* * *
