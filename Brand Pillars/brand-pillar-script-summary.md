### **Interview: Brand Strategy Questions**

#### **Question 1: Desired Work vs. Work to Stop**

**Speaker 1 (00:03)**
I'm going to answer these brand strategy questions.

**Question one: What type of work do you want more of and what do you wish you could stop doing?**

I would really like to have more clients like my best client that I have. They have about 8 employees, make about $3 million gross revenue per year, so they can absolutely afford a $1000 a month for 2 posts. One of the issues that they run into is that they don't really have time to gather content or assets.

So, **I wish I could stop chasing them around** and getting people to always send me things. I don't know if this is an issue of maybe I need to make it easier for people, or if I just need them sending me videos all the time—they're sending me photos and videos. But the thing I want to stop doing is chasing the clients around for content, because a lot of them say that they can't do it because they don't have time.

#### **Question 2: Favorite Client or Project**

**Speaker 1 (01:23)**
**Number two: Describe your absolute favourite client or project from the last year. What made it great?**

The very, very best thing was getting a client who said that they weren't sure if posting on Google and social would do anything for them. So what we did was we just did it for them on a trial; they got to sort of try it before they bought it.

It started working almost right away within that month. And then within the 2nd month, they had two different "a-ha!" moments. Within the 1st month, they started getting calls from Google because their profile was optimised. We put a bunch of photos and a bunch of videos in, changed the service area, added services in there, and optimised the about page—all the kind of stuff that you have to do for a full, complete profile. It just started getting them calls.

We also posted on social media, and it took a couple of months, and they got calls; they got some pretty big jobs from that. What's amazing is one of the first things they said was, "I'm not sure that there's any ROI from social," in fact, they were pretty convinced there wasn't going to be. But we did it anyway and totally proved them wrong.

**They were going from 1 to 2 calls per month. Now they are getting 3 to 4 calls per week** after we have done our service for them.

#### **Question 3: The Typical Client's Situation**

**Speaker 1 (02:58)**
**Number three: What type of client comes to you? When that type of client comes to you, what situation are they usually in? What's going on in their business that made them realise they need you?**

They are operating at a pretty good level, but they're kind of swamped in weeds, and they know that if they look better from a marketing perspective, it's going to attract more leads. It's going to cause people to not search around for multiple quotes so much. That's usually the situation they're in.

I've had conversations with quite a few clients that have ranged from being well-established in business to starting up. And they all kind of have the same issue, especially the good clients: they are at a certain level, but they realise that they're pretty invisible when it comes to being online, and they're really looking for the right situation. So what makes them realise that they need me is in the way that I talk about what we're going to do and how it's going to work for them. That's actually what happens.

Whenever I start talking about what we do and what we can do to solve their problem, it starts resonating with them, and they're always interested to see what it is that we can do.

For example, I had this client that was very concerned that their calendar wasn't booked out past, like, sometimes three weeks or six weeks. They have a staff, and if they didn't see anything coming in the email or didn't get any phone calls, they got worried. And that's a concern for any business owner. But I told him, I said, "Look, you really have to show up better on Google, you have to show up better on social media, your website needs to be on point." I said, "Because there's people out there looking at you online right now, but they're not choosing you because you don't appear legit."

Whenever I do our service for them, it's like there's a magic button; they see everything change. A lot of times what they're frustrated with is they don't want it to cost a lot, but that's kind of hard because marketing costs money. It's not like what we do costs a whole lot—it's less than a $1000 a month—but then they're also concerned about the time commitment to be able to get into handing me the assets I need, making the meetings, and stuff like that.

That's really a pain point for them and me: narrowing them down to be able to work through their issues with me because they're in this situation, capping and limiting their growth, or in this frustrating situation where they can't seem to get through what it is that they need to get through. It's like they had to change their habits; they have to invest money in marketing. And if I show them the right thing to do first, second, and third, with the minimal costs, that usually helps a lot.

A lot of times what they've already tried is like hiring a sales guy, sending out a bunch of email, doing something extra nice for a client and hoping that it increases the word-of-mouth. But the reality is, if they're not reaching out through what we're doing, that's a problem. If they're not putting everything on their Google Business Profile that they need to, if they're not putting stuff on social media, they're not getting reviews... it's a big deal.

---

#### **Question 4: Walk Through a Recent Project**

**Speaker 1 (07:18)**
**Question four: Walk me through a recent project from start to finish. What did the client come in wanting, and what did you actually deliver, and what changed for them?**

You know, I don't think that I really have an answer to this like a recent project. But I can say at this point, since we're really kind of going for what is the problem that we solve: **we really help businesses that are invisible become visible.**

This is a general thing across anybody that comes my way, because everybody says to me, "Hey, I need a website," or "I need to be on social," or "I need to do something online." They're not exactly sure what it is. And the problem that they all have is they're invisible. They're pretty much invisible and look closed; they look dead online.

It does take a process; it does take 2 to 3 months to see significant change. Sometimes it will happen sooner than that. It just depends on who's searching at what time and how well things are working already. But the issue is they all have the same problem: they're invisible. Always.

**So my process is to systematically make them more visible:**

1.  **Google Business Profile:** We're going to dive into their Google Business Profile, make sure that profile is fully optimised, then we're going to reply to every review, then we're going to coach them on how to get more reviews. (This is another friction point—them dedicating the time to do it, because most business owners are in a frenzy. It's almost impossible for them to create a new habit that isn't them being directly hands-on with the day-to-day operations of their business. It's almost impossible for them to do a different new thing to nurture new business, like asking for reviews.) But we reply to reviews, we help them get reviews, and those things right there always boost them up in the search results like within days.

2.  **Website:** Then, we go to their website next. We've got to make sure one, they have a website; two, that website has everything on it that it needs. There is a lot of things that Google Business Profile wants to see, search engine optimisation wants to see, and AI search optimisation wants to see as well.

3.  **Social Media:** Then we move on to their social. Everything that we're doing on Google Business has to go right over to their social. It's very important because the customers are going to look on Google Business Profile, website, and social media. Maybe they're going to do social media first, then website, but that's the 3 steps that every customer takes within 4 minutes to decide who they're going to call. So we help them win the 4-minute decision.

Our specific deliverables, how we approach this, is through helping them capture content every week and simply just upload it to us, and we edit it. And we do have strategy meetings with them every two weeks to make sure they know what they're getting, when we need it by, talking through who's going to do it, setting aside the time to do that—which is the biggest headache.

So I have to really find a special client that has somebody on their staff that is able to capture this stuff, because we take care of the hard part; they just have to do the 10-15% of capturing. We do absolutely everything else. And I think that is something that I lose people because of, to be honest. I lose people in the sales phase whenever they realise the work; it's like a lot of times I can't change their habit and get the work done.

#### **Question 5: The Cost of Inaction**

**Speaker 1 (11:27)**
**Number five: What's the cost to your ideal clients if they don't do this or if they do it badly? Not just the money, what else suffers?**

Honestly, what happens is **they don't get new jobs, so they don't grow.**

For instance, if 100 people a month are searching for their business, and there may be 1 of 4 businesses in the area where people are searching... think about that. If there's only 4 businesses in an area where people are searching for them (local business search), and they're not even being considered, they're not even showing up, you've got these other three businesses that are showing up. The lost opportunity is immeasurable.

You know, what would any business owner do if they could go from 1 to 2 calls a month to 3 to 4 calls per week? What would that change for them? That would be a revenue impact that is hundreds of times greater.

If they do it badly, they're going to lose money, they're going to lose time, and then they're going to be further convinced that this stuff doesn't work and further frustrated. Because doing stuff on your Google Business and social media and your website is actually so easy. It's not difficult. Yeah, it costs some money, but it doesn't cost $50,000. It doesn't even cost $10,000. The way we do it is so approachable that everybody should do it.

The impact on their reputation is going to be crazy too, because people are not going to see them for who they really are. We help them get authentic media, like videos and photos of their team, their process, everything.

---

#### **Question 6: The Client's "A-Ha!" Moment**

**Speaker 1 (13:11)**
**Number six: What do clients not understand about what you do until after they work with you? What's the "a-ha" moment they have?**

The "A-ha" moment is when that phone rings or an email comes in or somebody walks in the door. And then they say, "Hey, how did you find us?" ... "Well, Google."

Another client of mine, when I asked them, I said, "What's the impact been for you? Has it been worth it posting?" They said, "Yeah, people are coming in. I don't always ask, but I don't know where they're coming from. But they weren't coming in like they were until we started doing this."

The "A-ha" is usually the first time somebody new calls them and says, "Hey, I searched for you online." The reality is this can happen within the 1st month. People don't understand that.

Their Google Business Profile, social media, and website are there constantly, staring them in the face, and hopefully staring customers in the face, but usually not. It's such an underutilised asset.

**The difference between me and a competitor is I actually create an entire system** that involves multiple disciplines: copywriting, content strategy, project management, video editing, social media management and posting, coaching them on weekly engagement, handling some of that engagement myself, as well as optimising their profile and their website so that more people find them quickly. So I don't handle just one part of that overall marketing process; I do it all in order to get the result that they get more phone calls and emails.

So it always surprises them when it works. Usually it's that first one to three months where we're getting things set up that's the most nerve-racking for them, until they see that it works and they get relief. Because we aren't just relieving the problem of "Hey, does your service work?" We're relieving an entrenched problem that they've probably had for years or months, where they need to get more clients but they're struggling to do it.

#### **Follow-up on Question 3: The Client's Urgent Situation**

**Speaker 1 (15:27)**
I want to go back to question 3: "When that type of client comes to you, what situation are they usually in? What's going on in their business that made them realise they need you?"

A lot of them usually are pretty urgent to solve this because they're hurting on money each week. And it's like they're a day late and a dollar short; it's like they should have spent the money and took the time ages ago, but they didn't. And now them not having enough business is catching up with them, so that seems like they have even less money and less time to invest in it. So solving this problem becomes a challenge itself.

They've already tried absolutely everything they can within their realm of expertise. In their mind, they're thinking that maybe it's enough, or maybe it didn't work. They all know that they need to get it done. And then the enemy of this all becomes, "Well, I'm already getting enough business." But they really aren't; they're getting enough just to get by week-by-week or every month. But what they really want is they want their calendars booked out. These are local service businesses.

And back to number two, my absolute favourite client would be somebody who has the time and the money and sees that this is something they absolutely need; somebody who has talked with their staff or their board members or other directors in their business and have talked about it and said that, "Hey, we know we need somebody to do this, and we're willing to pay for it." That's who I'm looking for.

---

#### **Question 7: Why Clients Choose You**

**Speaker 1 (17:31)**
All right, we're going to go back to now the next question.

**Number seven: Why do your best clients choose you over other options? What do they tell you or what do they notice?**

They aren't choosing other marketing companies because I'm specifically going for small to medium businesses that haven't really invested in their presence this way in order to attract people. This is a unique situation because there's a lot of these people.

What I would essentially be competing against is not another company that does this, but all the ideas that they have about it. Maybe in different instances, they've tried different marketing agencies for different things, different freelancers for different things, maybe had different staff, maybe they had a family member or a business partner that is an expert. So really, that's what I'm coming against. They are comparing me to their previous knowledge and their experience.

So that is a very challenging thing for me to overcome, and it takes a long time to build that trust slowly. That's why I offer free for 30 days, free for four weeks; they can get into this and they can start working with this before they invest.

Whenever I notice that for some clients, after like month 3 or 4, they're very interested in paying us because they've seen results, like the phone ringing. In the first one to three months, they're wanting to make sure everything is getting done because they're paying not knowing what's going to happen. And that's really what we're competing against: the unknown, and the problem that hasn't been solved before.

Their deciding factor is they know they need to do something; they need to take a risk, and that's why they're coming to us.

So our UVP is we actually solve this problem that they haven't been able to solve. And when it's done right, it's going to give them a flood of business that they didn't know existed, because these are searches that are passing them by right now that they aren't capitalising on; these are phone calls being made to other businesses that could come to them.

It's such a simple positioning. They could just do it at any time, and it's not an astronomical unknown amount of money—it's very knowable, and the timeline is very realistic of when they're going to see results.

---

#### **Question 8: Your Unique Process**

**Speaker 1 (20:18)**
**Number eight: What's something you do as part of your normal process that your competitors either skip or charge extra for?**

I do a complete 6-part copywriting document called their Brand Pillars and Marketing Position. Then from that, I create their entire content strategy for them and put them on task to capture that, as well as doing all of the optimisation (which I know other people do), but I do it all from this standpoint of Brand Pillars so that everything we're doing is to get their ideal customer.

Most of my clients have never had this type of copywriting exercise done before. And it could cost $2,000 to $2,500 to get this done right. The way that I do it, I do it for free. I do that because it helps everything; it informs us on everything; it makes everything a lot easier.

So whenever they become my client, they get stuff that they don't get other places. And then the weekly process that I do is so easy to understand and so simple that it puts 95% of the workload on my team. All they have to do is capture, and attend a 20-minute meeting every two weeks to make sure we're staying on point with enough content and enough strategy.

They're sending me through a Jotform. We make sure that the media is authentic and transparent, because that's the polish in this day and age; people want to see authenticity and not polish. So we help them make sure that it's authentic; they're capturing it almost like raw.

---

#### **Question 9: Biggest Hesitation or Objection**

**Speaker 1 (22:03)**
**Question number nine: What's the biggest hesitation or objection you hear before someone decides to work with you, and what do they not realise yet?**

The biggest hesitation is they think we're very expensive. They hear "marketing" and they think some unknown dollar amount. That's just the biggest thing. It's much like talking to somebody in insurance or financial planning; you just think, "Okay, this is going to be thousands of dollars." They don't actually understand that.

And then whenever they see the price, they don't actually understand all the value that goes into it. So they have misconceptions; they want to call us "SEO" or they want to call us "social media management" or they want to call us something else that's very familiar to them, when it's not it. We really integrate and put together end-to-end a whole lot of processes, service, and value to get a result. We are "results as a service."

Okay, so price objections. The price is right—I mean, we are, for our founders, we're at $550 a month for one tier and $950 a month for another tier. That will go up after our first round of clients, but even when it goes up, it's not a big deal.

The education they need is they really need to understand where their business is without this vs. where it's going to be when they have it. So they can see that this is the thing that's going to make the difference.

It's cheaper than hiring staff. And it's better than hiring a marketing agency at some unknown amount of money. And it's a guaranteed result because we're giving Google what Google wants, and we're giving the people who are searching what they want, which is then, in turn, giving the business that we're working with—our client—what they want, which is more phone calls, more emails, and less price resistance to quotes.

---

#### **Question 10: One Thing for Ideal Clients to Understand**

**Speaker 1 (24:21)**
**Number 10: If you could get inside your ideal client's head to make them deeply understand one thing about working with you—what they'll actually get or how to help them—what would this be?**

If I could get in their head and make them understand one thing: **this investment pays back after 2 or 3 months, and you have more money. So you're not actually losing any money.**

I know what matters to them is they're crunched on time, they're crunched on money, they don't know if they can pull it off. But if they would just change some habits and shift some priorities around, they would definitely increase.

So if they could just not be afraid to make that jump... it could be $2-3,000 over 3 months, but that's peanuts compared to not getting it, and it's peanuts compared to hiring staff to do it.

They're going to feel better. They're going to be able to provide more jobs. (One of my clients has hired 3 more people since working with us since the beginning of the year, within 8 months.) They're going to have more money as business owners to be able to do the things that they want.

They're not going to have to worry about where all their leads are coming from, because they're going to have another very reliable lead source that's very evergreen and not going to change much at all. And when it does, we're going to be on top of those changes and implementing them in real-time because we're passionate about that.
