Speaker 1 (00:03)
I'm gonna answer these brand strategy questions. Question one, what type of work do you want more of and what do you wish you could stop doing? I would really like to have more clients like my best client that I have. 

Speaker 1 (00:21)
They have about 8 employees make about $3 million, gross revenue per year. So they can absolutely afford a $1000 a month for 2 posts. And one of the issues that they run into is that they don't really have time to gather content or assets. 

Speaker 1 (00:43)
So I wish I could stop chasing them around. And getting people to always send me things so I don't know if this is an issue of like maybe I need to make it easier for people on citizening me just straight up videos. All the time, they're sending me photos and videos. 

Speaker 1 (01:03)
But the thing I want to stop doing is chasing the clients around for content, because a lot of them say that they can't do it because they don't have time. But I don't know anyways. Number two, describe your absolute favourite client or project from the last year. 

Speaker 1 (01:23)
What made it great? The very, very best thing was getting a client who said that they weren't sure if posting on Google and social would do anything for them. And so what we did was We just, you know, did it for them on a trial, they got to sort of try it before they bought it. 

Speaker 1 (01:50)
And it started working almost right away within that month. And then within the 2nd month, they had two different Sort of like a ha moments to wear within the 1st month, they started getting calls from Google, because they showed app because their profile was optimised. We put a bunch of photos in their bunch of videos and you know, change the service area. 

Speaker 1 (02:14)
Added services in there and optimise the about page all the kind of stuff that you have to do. A full complete profile just started getting them calls And then we also posted a social media, and it took a couple of months, and they got calls, they got some pretty big jobs from that. And what's amazing is one of the first things they said was, I'm not sure that there's any Roy from social, in fact, they were pretty convinced there wasn't going to be, but we did it anyway and totally proved them wrong. 

Speaker 1 (02:45)
They were going from 1 to 2 calls per month. Now they are 3 to 4 calls per week. After we have Done our service for them. 

Speaker 1 (02:58)
Number three, what type of client comes to you? What number three, when A When that type of client comes to you, what situation are you usually in? What's going on in their business? 

Speaker 1 (03:10)
That made them realise they need you really what's going on as they are operating at a pretty good level. But they're kind of scarce on weeds, and they know that if they look better from a marketing perspective, it's going to attract more leads, it's going to cause people to not search around for multiple Coats so much, that's usually the situation they're in. I've had conversations. 

Speaker 1 (03:35)
With quite a few clients that Quite a few clients that have ranged from being well established in business to starting up. And they all kind of have the same issue, especially the good clients are at a certain level, but they realise that they're pretty invisible when it comes to being online and they're really looking for. The right situation, so what makes them realise that they need me is in the way that I talk about what we're going to do and how it's going to work for them. 

Speaker 1 (04:13)
That's that's actually what happens. So Whenever I start talking about just What we do it really and what we can do to solve their problem, it starts resonating with them, and they're always interested to see. What it is that we can do? 

Speaker 1 (04:38)
Um, so for example, I had this client that Was very concerned that their calendar wasn't booked out past like sometimes three weeks or six weeks when they have a staff and if they didn't see anything coming in the email or didn't get any phone calls, they got like worried and that's a concern for any business owner. But I told him I said, look, you know, you really had to show app better on Google, you had to show a better on social media, your website needs to be on point I said, because there's people out there looking at you online right now, but they're not choosing you because you don't appear legit. 

Speaker 1 (05:23)
In Whenever I do our service for them at anytime. You know, they they, it's like there's a magic button. They see everything change and a lot of times what they're frustrated with is they don't want it to cost a lot, but that's kind of hard, because, you know, marketing costs money and it's not like what we do costs a whole lot. 

Speaker 1 (05:48)
It's less than a $1000 a month and but then they're also concerned about the time commitment to be able to get into handing me the assets I need making the meetings and stuff like that. And that's really like a pain point for them and me is narrowing narrowing them down to be able to work through their issues with me because they're in this situation. 

Speaker 2 (06:14)
Um. 

Speaker 1 (06:15)
You know, kind of caping and limiting their growth are in this frustrating situation where they can't seem to get through what it is that they need to get through. But it's like they had to change their habits, you know, they have to invest money in marketing. And if I show them the right thing to do first second, and third, with the minimal costs that usually helps a lot. 

Speaker 1 (06:42)
In a lot of times what they've already tried is like hiring a sales guy. Sending out a bunch of email. 

Speaker 2 (06:50)
Um. 

Speaker 1 (06:51)
Doing something extra nice for a client. And hoping that it increases the word-of-mouth, but the reality is if they're not reaching out Through what we're doing, that's that's like a problem. You know, if they're not putting everything on their Google business that they need to if they're not putting stuff on social media, they're not getting reviews, it's like it's like a big deal. 

Speaker 1 (07:18)
Question for walk me through a recent project. From start to finish, what do the client come in wanting, and what did you actually deliver and what change for them? You know, I don't think that I really have An answer to this like a recent project. 

Speaker 1 (07:38)
But I can say at this point Since we're really kind of going for what is the problem that we solve, we really help businesses that are invisible, become visible. And this is sort of a general thing across anybody that comes my way, because everybody says to me, like, Hey, I need a website or I need to be on social or I need to do something online. They're not exactly sure what it is. 

Speaker 1 (08:13)
And the problem that they all have, is they're invisible. They're they're pretty much invisible and look closed, they look dead online. And it does take a process, it does take 2 to 3 months to see significant change. 

Speaker 1 (08:28)
Sometimes it will happen sooner than that. It just kind of depends on, you know, who's searching at what time and you know, how, well things are working already, but the issue is like they all have the same problem that they're invisible. Always so my process is to systematically make them more visible. 

Speaker 1 (08:51)
So number one, we're going to dive into their Google business profile, we're going to make sure that profile is fully optimised, then we're going to reply to every review, then we're going to coach them on how to get more reviews. And this is another friction point them dedicating the time to do it, because most business owners are like in a frenzy. And it's like almost impossible for them to create a new habit that isn't them being directly hands-on with the day-to-day operations of their business. 

Speaker 1 (09:20)
It's almost impossible for them to do like a different new thing. In order to nurture new business like asking for reviews, but, you know, we reply reviews. We help them get reviews and those things, right there always boost them up in the search results like within days. 

Speaker 1 (09:40)
Then, we go to their website next, we got to make sure one. They have a website 2. That website has everything on that it needs. 

Speaker 1 (09:49)
So there is a lot of things that Google business profile wants to see search engine optimisation wants to see an AI search. Optimisation wants to see as well. And then we move on to their social, like everything that we're doing on Google business has to go right over to their social It's very important because the customers are going to look on Google, business profile website and social media. 

Speaker 1 (10:14)
Maybe they're going to do social media first, then website, but that's the 3 steps that every customer takes within 4 minutes to decide who they're going to call so we help them. When the 4 minute decision and really the our specific deliverables, how we approach, this is through helping them capture content every week, and simply just upload it to us and we edit it, and we do have strategy meetings with them every two weeks, to make sure they know what they're getting, when we need it. By talking through who's going to do it? 

Speaker 1 (10:53)
Setting aside the time to do that, which is the biggest headache. So I have to really find like a special client that has somebody on their staff that is able to capture this stuff because we take care of the hard part, they just have to do, like the 1015% of capturing, we do absolutely everything else. And I think that is something that You know, I lose people because of that, to be honest, like I lose people in the in the sales phase whenever they realise you know what the work is, it's like they a lot of times I can't change their habit and get the work done. 

Speaker 1 (11:27)
Number five, what's the cost to your ideal clients if they don't do this or if they do it badly, not just the money, what else suffers? Honestly, what happens is, they don't get new jobs, so they don't grow. For instance, if a 100 people a month are searching for their business, and there may be 1 of 4 businesses in the area where people are searching think about that if there's only 4 businesses in an area where people are searching for them, local business search, and they're not even being considered. 

Speaker 1 (12:00)
They're not even showing app that you got these other three businesses that are kinda showing up in a bunch of other unrelated businesses, because that's what Google Maps does it tries to feature just anybody to try to solve the problem. The last opportunity is immeasurable. You know, what would any business owner do if they could go from 1 to 2 calls a month to 3 to 4 calls per week? 

Speaker 1 (12:24)
What would that change for them? That would be a revenue impact That is, I don't know how many hundreds of times greater than what it is. Um, if they do it badly, they're going to lose money, they're going to lose time, and then they're going to be further convinced that this stuff doesn't work and further frustrated. 

Speaker 1 (12:46)
Because Doing stuff on your Google business and social media and your website is actually so easy. It's not difficult. Yeah, it costs some money, but it doesn't cost $50000. 

Speaker 1 (12:58)
It doesn't even cost $10000 the way we do. It is so approachable that everybody should do it. Um, and the impact on their reputation is going to be crazy too. 

Speaker 1 (13:11)
Because there people are not going to see them for who they really are. We help them get authentic media like videos and photos of their team. Their process, everything Number six, what do clients not understand about what you do? 

Speaker 1 (13:27)
Until after they work with you, what's the ahaw moment? They have the Aha moment is when that phone rings or an email comes in or somebody walks in the door. And then they say, Hey, how do you find this? 

Speaker 1 (13:37)
Well, Google another client of mine, when I asked them, I said, what's the impact been for you? Has it been worth it posting? This is yeah, people are coming in, I don't always ask, but I don't know where they're coming from. 

Speaker 1 (13:50)
But they weren't coming in, like they were, until we started doing this. The Ah is usually at the first time, somebody knew calls them and says, Hey, I searched for you online. Um, and the reality is this can happen within the 1st month. 

Speaker 1 (14:10)
People don't understand that. And really, it's like their Google business profile, and their social media and their website are there constantly starring them in the face and hopefully staring customers in the face but usually not it's such an underutilised asset that they are not even taking into consideration. And the difference between me and a competitor is, I actually create an entire system That involves multiple disciplines, copyrighting content strategy, project management video, editing, social media management and posting coaching them on weekly engagement and handling some of that engagement myself as well as optimising their profile and their website so that more people find them quickly, so I don't handle just one part of that overall marketing. 

Speaker 1 (15:02)
Process, I do it all in order to get the result that they get more phone calls and emails. So it always surprises them when it works and usually it's that first one to 3 months, where we're getting things set up, that's like the most nerve-racking for them until they see that it works and they get relief, because we aren't just relieving the problem of like, Hey. Does your service work? 

Speaker 1 (15:27)
We're relieving an entrenched problem that they've probably had for years or months to where they need to get more clients, but they're struggling to do it. I want to go back to question 3 When that type of client comes to you, what situation are they usually in what's going on of a business that made them realise they need you and A lot of them usually are pretty urgent to solve this because they're hurting on money each week. And it's like they're a day late in a dollar short, it's like they should have spent the money and took The Times ago, but they didn't. 

Speaker 1 (16:08)
And now them not having enough business is catching up with him, so that seems like they have even less money and less time. To invest in it, so solving this problem becomes a challenge itself. And they've already tried absolutely everything they can within their realm of expertise and like, in their mind. 

Speaker 1 (16:27)
They're thinking that maybe it's enough, or maybe it didn't work, or maybe it's like this big deal. And they all know that they need to get it done. And then the enemy of this all becomes like, well, I'm already getting enough business. 

Speaker 1 (16:41)
But they really aren't, they're getting enough. Just to get him by week by week, are every month. But what they really want is they want their calendars booked out. 

Speaker 1 (16:48)
These are local serviced businesses And the back to number two, my absolute favourite client would be somebody who has the time and the money and sees that this is something they absolutely need somebody who has talked with their staff or their board members or other directors in there and their business and have talked about it and said that Hey, we know we need somebody to do this, and we're willing to pay for it. That's who I'm looking for. All right, we're going to go back to Now, the next question number seven Why do your best clients choose you over other options? 

Speaker 1 (17:31)
What do they tell you or what do they notice? They cared about my clients are not choosing other marketing companies because I'm specifically going for small to medium businesses that haven't really invested in there. Their presence this way, in order to attract people And this is a unique situation, because There's a lot of these people. 

Speaker 1 (18:03)
And what I would essentially be competing against is not another company that does this. But all the ideas that they have about it, maybe in different instances, maybe they've tried different marketing agencies for different things, different freelancers for different things, maybe had different staff, maybe they had a family member or a business partner, that is an expert. So really, that's what I'm coming against. 

Speaker 1 (18:26)
They are comparing me to their previous knowledge and their experience. So that is a very challenging thing for me to overcome, and it takes a long time to build that trust kind of slowly. That's why I offer free for 30 days. 

Speaker 1 (18:43)
Free for four weeks, they can get into this, and they can start working with this before they invest. And it's whenever I notice that for some clients, after, like, month 3 or 4 They're very interested in paying us because they've seen revolt results. They're very interested in paying us because they've seen some revolts like results, like the phone ringing, or whatever they're very interested in paying us, because they've seen some results in the first one to 3 months. 

Speaker 1 (19:18)
It's like they're wanting to make sure everything is getting done, because they're paying, not knowing what's going to happen. And that's really what we're competing against is the unknown, and the problem that hasn't been solved before. And so they're deciding factor as they know, they need to do something, they need to take a risk, and that's why they're coming to us. 

Speaker 1 (19:41)
Um, so our uvp, as we actually solve this problem. That they haven't been able to solve, and when it's done right, it's going to give them a flood of business that they didn't know existed, because these are searches that are passing them by right now that they aren't capitalising on, these are phone calls being made to other. Businesses that could come to them. 

Speaker 1 (20:03)
It's such a simple positioning. That they could just do it at anytime, and it's not an astronomical unknown amount of money, it's very knowable, and the timeline is very realistic. Of when they're going to see results. 

Speaker 1 (20:18)
Number eight, what's something you do? As part of your normal process that your competitors either skip or charge extra for I do a complete 6 part copyrighting document called their brand pillars and marketing position, then from that I create their entire content strategy for them and put them on task to capture that as well as doing all of the optimisation which I know other people do, but I do it all from this standpoint of brand pillars, so that everything that we're doing is to get their ideal customer. 

Speaker 1 (20:48)
Most of my clients have never had this type of copyrighting exercise done before. And it could cost $20:00 to $2500 to get this done right the way that I do it, I do it for free. And I do that, because it helps everything, it informs us on everything it makes everything a lot easier. 

Speaker 1 (21:08)
So whenever they become my client, they get stuff that They don't get other places. And then the weekly process that I do is so easy to understand. And so simple that it puts 95% of the workload on my team and all they have to do is capture, and attend a 20 minute meeting every two weeks to make sure we're staying on point with enough content and enough strategy that they're sinning me through a jot form. 

Speaker 1 (21:41)
We make sure that the media is authentic. And transparent, because that's the Polish at this day and age, people want to see authenticity and not Polish, so we help them make sure that it's authentic. They're capturing it almost like raw question number nine, what's the biggest hesitation or objection you hear before someone decides to work with you. 

Speaker 1 (22:03)
And what do they not realise yet? Um, the biggest hesitation is they think we're very expensive. They hear marketing, and they think some unknown dollar amount. 

Speaker 1 (22:18)
That's just the biggest thing. It's much like talking to somebody in insurance or financial planning that you just think, okay, this is going to be thousands of dollars. They don't actually understand that. 

Speaker 1 (22:31)
And then whenever they see the price, they don't actually understand all the value that goes into it. So they have misconceptions, they want to call us SEO or they want to call us social media management. Or they want to call us something else. 

Speaker 1 (22:47)
That's very familiar to them. When it's not it, we really integrate and put together in to end a whole lot of 

Speaker 2 (22:56)
Um. 

Speaker 1 (22:56)
You know, processes service and value to get a result. We are results as a service Okay, so price objections, the price is right. I mean, we are at for our founders. 

Speaker 1 (23:12)
We're at $550 a month for one tier and $950 a month for another tier, that will go up. After our first round of clients But even when it goes up, it's it's not a big deal. So And the education they need is they really need to understand where their business is without this Vs where it's going to be when they have it. 

Speaker 1 (23:40)
So they can see that this is the thing that's going to make the difference. It's cheaper than hiring staff. And it's better than hiring a marketing agency at some unknown amount of money in it's a guaranteed result, because we're giving Google what Google once and we're giving the people who are searching what they want, which is then in turn giving the business that we're working with our client. 

Speaker 1 (24:01)
What they want, which is more phone calls, more emails and less price resistance to quotes. Number 10, if you could get inside your ideal clients, how to make them deeply understand one thing about working with you. What they'll actually get or how to help them, what will this be? 

Speaker 1 (24:21)
If I could get in their head and make them understand one thing that this investment pays back. After 2 or 3 months, and you have more money. So you're not actually losing any money. 

Speaker 1 (24:37)
And I know what matters to them is like, they're crunched on time. They're crunched on money, they don't know if they can pull off, but if they would just change some habits and shift some priorities around, they would definitely increase. Definitely increase. 

Speaker 1 (24:52)
So if they could just not be afraid to make that jump yach could be 2 or $3000 over 3 months. But that's peanuts, compared to not getting it in its peanuts, compared to a few hired staff to do it. They're going to feel better, they're going to be able to provide more jobs. 

Speaker 1 (25:10)
One of my clients has hired 3 more people since working with us since the beginning of the year within 8 months. They're going to have more money as business owners. To be able to do the things that they want. 

Speaker 1 (25:21)
They're not going to have to worry about where are all their leads coming from, because they're going to have another very reliable lead source that's very evergreen and not going to change much at all, and when it does, we're going to be on top of those changes in implementing them in real-time, because we're passionate about that.
