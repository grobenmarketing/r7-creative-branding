### The 4-Minute Marketing System

**Headline:** THE 4-MINUTE MARKETING SYSTEM

**Subheadline:** John needs your service right now. His boss just dropped an emergency project. He opens Google Maps and searches. You have exactly 4 minutes.

**Step 1: 11:56 AM - The Search Begins**

John searches for your service in Google Maps. The clock is ticking. Google Business Profile rankings determine who even shows up.

**Step 2: The Instant Elimination**

Three businesses get eliminated immediately: No recent photos on Google Business Profile, old reviews, incomplete profiles. Dead digital storefronts.

**Step 3: The Website Check**

Two businesses remain. John clicks to their websites. One looks outdated and generic - browser tab closed, never called.

**Step 4: The Final Social Proof**

The winner has an active Google Business Profile with weekly content, a trustworthy website, and social media showing they're actively serving customers. John calls. He books. Game over.

**Bottom Line:** You're not losing on price or quality. You're losing because your Google Business Profile looks like you've gone fishing.

**Stats:**
- 8/10 Businesses lose the 4-minute race
- ZERO Calls to invisible businesses  
- 100% Preventable with the right system

### Our Solution Section

**Headline:** We Optimize Your Google Business Profile to Win Every 4-Minute Decision

**Subheadline:** Google ranks businesses on three factors: Relevance, Distance, and Prominence. We feed Google exactly what it needs to put you first.

**The Foundation: Google Business Profile Domination**

Your Google Business Profile is where the 4-minute decision starts. We optimize it completely:

- **Relevance:** Complete profile optimization with strategic keywords
- **Prominence:** Weekly photos and videos showing active business operations  
- **Review Management:** Human responses to every review, systems to generate fresh reviews
- **Weekly Content:** The evidence Google's algorithm needs to rank you higher
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track calls, clicks, and direction requests

**The Trust Sequence: Website + Social Proof**

After they find you on Google, prospects check your website and social media:

- **Website Optimization:** Trustworthy design optimized for search and AI
- **Social Media Activity:** Weekly proof you're actively serving customers
- **Consistent Branding:** Professional presence across all platforms

**How "You Capture, We Create" Works:**

We make this painless for you:

1. **Bi-Weekly Strategy Calls:** We plan your next 6-8 content pieces (15 minutes, twice per month)
2. **You Capture:** Spend 10-20 minutes per week taking photos/videos on your phone of work you're already doing
3. **We Create:** Professional editing, strategic captions, Google Business Profile optimization
4. **Content Goes Live:** Automated posting across Google Business Profile and social media
5. **Google Ranks You Higher:** Fresh weekly content signals an active, prominent business

**Why This Works:**

Google's algorithm rewards businesses that consistently prove they're actively serving customers. Weekly photos and videos of real work create the prominence signal Google needs. When prospects see fresh evidence every week, they trust you 2.7x more than competitors with stale profiles.

### The 9 Components of 4-Minute Marketing

**Headline:** The Complete System That Dominates Your Market

**Subheadline:** This isn't just content creation. It's a strategic system that optimizes every touchpoint in the 4-minute decision window.

**1. Google Business Profile Optimization**

Complete profile setup with strategic keywords, service areas, business hours, and category optimization. This creates the "relevance" signal Google needs.

**2. Weekly Content for Prominence**  

2-3 professionally edited posts per week (104-156 pieces of content annually) posted directly to your Google Business Profile. This creates the "prominence" signal that pushes you higher in local search rankings.

**3. Review Generation & Management**

Systems to generate fresh positive reviews with human responses to every review. Reviews are a critical prominence factor in Google's ranking algorithm.

**4. Strategic Content Planning**

Bi-weekly 15-minute calls where we plan exactly what content to capture, when, and how. You never waste time wondering what to post.

**5. Professional Editing & Captions**

We transform your raw smartphone captures into polished content with strategic captions optimized for your target market.

**6. Website Optimization**

Trustworthy design optimized for search engines and AI, creating confidence when prospects click through from your Google Business Profile.

**7. Social Media Consistency**

Your content automatically posts to Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms, providing the final social proof prospects need.

**8. Brand Pillars & Messaging**

Clear framework for your message: ideal customer, core offer, and unique value. This ensures every piece of content builds your position in the market.

**9. Asset Library & Repurposing**

We build a library of your best content and repurpose it strategically for maximum long-term value.

## RESULTS PAGE

### Hero Section

**Headline:** Real Businesses Who Stopped Losing the 4-Minute Decision

**Subheadline:** See how Google Business Profile optimization and weekly content turned browser tab eliminations into phone calls

**Body:** These businesses were invisible on Google Business Profile - stale photos, no recent activity, incomplete profiles. Prospects eliminated them in seconds. Here's what happened when we optimized their Google presence and implemented weekly content.

**Tagline:** Human Touch Marketing in an AI & Automated World

---

### Client Story 1: The Solar Company's Appointment Cancelation Problem

**The Problem:**  

They scheduled 10 appointments and watched 6-7 evaporate. Their Google Business Profile told the story: only 8 reviews, no photos showing recent work, last post was 6 months ago. When prospects googled them before appointments, they saw a business that looked closed. 

Appointment no-shows were costing them $15,000-20,000 per month in lost revenue.

**The Solution:**  

Week 1: Complete Google Business Profile optimization - updated all business information, added service categories, optimized for local search.

Weeks 2-4: Started posting weekly photos of solar installations to Google Business Profile. Added video of the installation process. Responded personally to all existing reviews.

Weeks 5-8: Implemented review generation system. Fresh 5-star reviews started appearing weekly. Social media synchronized with Google Business Profile content.

Result: When prospects googled them before appointments, they now saw an active business with recent installations, happy customers, and professional presence.

**The Result:**  

Appointment show-up rate jumped from 30% to 60-70% within 60 days. Sales increased proportionally. Google Business Profile calls increased 40%. Website clicks from Google Business Profile up 65%.

**Testimonial:**  

"We were getting too many appointment cancelations. We didn't realize prospects were googling us and seeing nothing recent. After we fixed our Google Business Profile and added weekly content, the growth was unbelievable. People actually comment on our social media now." - Alan, Marketing Director

**Key Metric:** Recovered $30,000-35,000 monthly revenue from reduced appointment cancelations

---

### Client Story 2: From Invisible on Google to Major Contract Win

**The Problem:**  

Completely invisible on Google Business Profile. Last post: 14 months ago. No photos of recent work. No review responses. When local businesses searched Google Maps for their service, this company didn't even appear in the top 10 results.

They were missing opportunities from large companies who exclusively used Google to find local vendors.

**The Solution:**  

Week 1: Emergency Google Business Profile optimization - complete profile rebuild, strategic keyword placement, service area expansion.

Week 2: Posted 5 pieces of content showing recent work to signal "active business" to Google's algorithm.

Week 3-4: Connected social media profiles to Google Business Profile. Started bi-weekly content captures.

Week 5: Google Business Profile ranking improved from not visible to positions 3-5 for key search terms.

**The Result:**  

Within 2 weeks of making Google Business Profile active, a major power company discovered them through Facebook, clicked to their Google Business Profile (now showing fresh weekly content), browsed their website, and contacted them about a massive vehicle wrapping contract worth $47,000.

**Testimonial:**  

"The power company told us they found us on Facebook, but then they checked everything - our Google profile, our website, our reviews. Everything looked professional and active. Everyone tells me they've seen us on social media and love it. It does seem like there's less price resistance to our quotes now." - Mark, President

**Key Metric:** $47,000 contract within 30 days of Google Business Profile optimization

---

### Client Story 3: The HVAC Company That Didn't Exist on Google

**The Problem:**  

Zero activity on Google Business Profile for 18+ months. When homeowners searched "HVAC repair near me" on Google Maps, this company didn't show up in map results. Their Google Business Profile had 12 reviews but looked abandoned - no photos, no posts, no responses to reviews.

Phone wasn't ringing from online searches despite having 20 years of excellent service history.

**The Solution:**  

Immediate Google Business Profile revival:
- Posted 3 pieces of recent work content in first week
- Responded to all 12 existing reviews personally  
- Added 15 photos of recent installations and repairs
- Set up weekly content schedule: every Monday and Thursday

Within 2 weeks: Google Business Profile started appearing in map results for local searches.

**The Result:**  

Week 3: First call from a homeowner who said "I found you on your Google profile page. You guys looked really active and professional."

Month 2: Phone calls from Google Business Profile increased from 0-1 per month to 8-12 per month.

Month 3: Google Business Profile ranking for "HVAC repair [city name]" moved from position 15+ to positions 4-6.

**Testimonial:**  

"For the longest time the phone would ring from referrals and repeat customers. We didn't realize we were completely invisible on Google. Not too long after we started posting weekly to Google Business Profile, we started getting calls from people who found us on Google. Now about 30% of our new customers find us that way." - Cody, Owner/Operator

**Key Metric:** Went from 0-1 calls per month from Google to 8-12 calls per month

---

### Results Section

**Headline:** What Our Clients Experience After Google Business Profile Optimization

**Results Data:**

- 25-50% more phone calls from Google Business Profile
- 35-70% more website clicks from local search
- 15-30% less price resistance on quotes
- 2.7x more trustworthy appearance online
- Higher rankings in Google Maps local search results
- Increased "direction requests" to business location
- More appointment show-ups (prospects pre-qualify themselves)

**Philosophy:**  

"We're a results-as-a-service company. We combine proven marketing disciplines with current platform best practices that have delivered measurable outcomes for over 20 years. 

Our approach isn't about following trends - it's about understanding how Google ranks businesses and feeding the algorithm exactly what it needs. We focus on the three ranking factors Google actually uses: relevance, distance, and prominence.

Then we optimize the trust sequence: Google Business Profile → Website → Social Media. Because that's the order prospects evaluate you in their 4-minute decision window.

This isn't theory. It's implementing strategies that drive phone calls, quote requests, and faster 'yes' decisions. Because that's what matters to your business." - R7 Creative Results Philosophy

## HOW IT WORKS PAGE

### Hero Section

**Headline:** Google Business Profile Optimization + "You Capture, We Create"

**Subheadline:** The system that feeds Google's ranking algorithm while requiring just 10-20 minutes per week from you

**Tagline:** Human Touch Marketing in an AI & Automated World

---

### How It Works Section

**Headline:** Our Proven 4-Step Process

**Subheadline:** We optimize your Google Business Profile first, then implement a weekly content system that keeps you ranked high and looking trustworthy

---

#### Step 1: Google Business Profile Foundation (Week 1)

**What We Do:**

Complete optimization of your Google Business Profile for Google's three ranking factors:

**Relevance:**
- Strategic service categories and keywords
- Complete business information (hours, services, service area)
- Optimized business description for target market
- Q&A section setup

**Initial Prominence Boost:**
- Upload 10-15 high-quality photos of your work
- Create initial posts showing recent activity
- Respond to all existing reviews personally
- Set up review generation system

**Technical Setup:**
- Link website and social media profiles
- Install messaging and call tracking
- Set up analytics and reporting
- Optimize for mobile search

**Your Investment:** 1-hour strategy session to understand your business, target market, and core services

---

#### Step 2: Bi-Weekly Strategy Calls (15 Minutes Each)

**What We Do:**

Every two weeks, we plan your next 6-8 content pieces with specific capture instructions:

- Exactly what to photograph or video
- When to capture it (assigned dates/times)
- Who should capture it (which team member)
- Why this content matters for Google's algorithm

**Example Content Assignment:**

"Tuesday 2:00 PM - Have Mike capture 60-second video of the diagnostic process on the Johnson job. Focus on the equipment and show him explaining what he found. This demonstrates expertise and active service delivery for Google Business Profile."

**Your Investment:** 15 minutes, twice per month (we lead the call, you just show up)

---

#### Step 3: You Capture (10-20 Minutes Per Week)

**What You Do:**

Follow the content plan we created. Use your smartphone to capture the assigned content at your job sites:

- 15-60 second videos of work in progress
- 2-3 photos of each process or completed project  
- Brief team member introductions
- Customer testimonial recordings (with permission)

**Upload via JotForm by Friday 7:00 PM**

No editing required. No caption writing. No thinking about "what to post." Just capture what we assigned and upload it.

**Critical Qualifier:** If you can't commit to this weekly capture, we're not the right partner. This system requires authentic content from your actual business operations.

---

#### Step 4: We Create & Optimize (Weekly)

**What We Do:**

Transform your raw captures into strategic content optimized for Google Business Profile and your target market:

**Professional Editing:**
- Video editing (cuts, color correction, audio enhancement)
- Photo optimization for Google Business Profile
- Strategic formatting for platform requirements
- Compliance with Google's content guidelines (no fancy transitions or excessive effects)

**Strategic Captions:**
- Written for your target market and brand voice
- Optimized for Google Business Profile search
- Call-to-action appropriate to content type
- Keyword integration without spam

**Posting & Distribution:**
- Primary: Google Business Profile (this is your foundation)
- Secondary: Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms
- Scheduled for optimal visibility
- Monitored for engagement and performance

**Review Management:**
- Personal responses to all new reviews
- Review generation prompts sent to recent customers
- Reputation monitoring and crisis management

---

#### Step 5: Content Goes Live & Google Responds

**What Happens:**

Your content posts automatically across all platforms. But here's what matters most:

**Google Business Profile Impact:**
- Fresh weekly content signals "prominent active business" to Google's algorithm
- Your ranking for local searches improves over 30-90 days
- More prospects see your Google Business Profile when searching
- Your profile shows recent photos/videos when prospects evaluate you

**Prospect Behavior Changes:**
- They see you're actively serving customers RIGHT NOW
- Trust increases 2.7x compared to stale profiles
- Less price resistance (you look more legitimate)
- Faster decision-making (they don't need to keep searching)

**Business Results:**
- 25-50% more phone calls from Google Business Profile within 60 days
- 35-70% more website clicks from local search
- More appointment show-ups (fewer no-shows)
- Better quality leads (they pre-qualify themselves)

### The 9 Components of 4-Minute Marketing

**Headline:** The Complete System

**Subheadline:** Google Business Profile optimization is the foundation. These 9 components create complete market domination.

[Same 9 components as homepage, but with additional context about how each feeds Google's algorithm or builds trust in the decision sequence]

---

### How We're Different

**Headline:** We Start Where The 4-Minute Decision Starts: Google Business Profile

**Subheadline:** Most agencies focus on followers and engagement. We focus on Google's ranking algorithm and the trust sequence prospects actually follow.

**Traditional Marketing Agencies:**

- Create all content without understanding Google's ranking factors
- Focus on social media followers and vanity metrics
- Don't optimize Google Business Profile (the actual starting point)
- Generic content that doesn't signal "active business" to Google
- Expensive monthly retainers ($2,000-5,000+)
- Long contracts and complex packages
- Can't explain why results matter to your bottom line

**R7 Creative "You Capture, We Create":**

- Start with Google Business Profile optimization (where prospects start)
- Focus on Google's 3 ranking factors: relevance, distance, prominence  
- Weekly content specifically designed to feed Google's algorithm
- Optimize the actual trust sequence: GBP → Website → Social
- Results we track: calls, clicks, rankings, revenue impact
- Affordable investment ($550-950/month)
- Month-to-month, cancel with 30 days notice
- Your authentic work becomes the content (10 mins/week from you)
- Every strategy decision connects to business results

**The Critical Difference:**

We understand that prospects don't find you on Instagram. They find you on Google Maps when searching for your service. That's where the 4-minute decision starts.

Everything we do feeds Google's ranking algorithm first, builds trust second, and creates social proof third. In that exact order. Because that's the order your prospects follow.

### Value Proposition

**Headline:** The Real Cost of Looking Closed Online

**The Problem:**

**Lost Opportunities:**  
Every month, 2-5 qualified prospects search for your service on Google, find you in map results, click on your Google Business Profile, see no recent activity, and eliminate you within 60 seconds. They never call. They never click to your website. Your browser tab just closes.

At an average job value of $2,000-5,000, you're losing $4,000-25,000 in monthly revenue.

**Invisible to Search:**  
80% of local businesses have dead Google Business Profiles. No recent photos. No posts. No activity signals. Google's algorithm sees this and ranks you lower. You don't even appear in the first 10 results for prospects searching your service.

**Competitor Advantage:**  
While you look inactive, competitors with optimized Google Business Profiles and weekly content capture YOUR potential customers. They look more trustworthy, more active, more legitimate - not because they're better, but because they're visible.

---

**The Solution:**

**Stop the Elimination:**  
Weekly content on your Google Business Profile proves you're actively serving customers RIGHT NOW. Prospects see evidence of recent work and trust you immediately.

**Rank Higher in Search:**  
Google's algorithm rewards "prominent" businesses with fresh weekly content. You climb rankings in Google Maps results. More prospects see you first.

**Build Instant Trust:**  
When prospects click your Google Business Profile, they see photos and videos from this week. Your website is professional. Your social media is active. You look 2.7x more trustworthy than competitors with stale profiles.

**Get More Calls:**  
Our clients experience 25-50% more phone calls from Google Business Profile within 60 days. That's 3-6 additional qualified leads per month calling YOU instead of competitors.

✓ Local service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, solar, contractors, vehicle wraps, home services)  
✓ Companies losing calls to competitors who look more active  
✓ Businesses with 2-20 employees who can capture content weekly  
✓ Business owners tired of being eliminated in browser tabs

---

### FAQ Section

**How quickly will I see results?**

Google Business Profile optimization and initial content posting happen in Week 1-2. Most businesses see increased activity within 30 days as Google's algorithm recognizes the fresh prominence signals.

Biggest improvements come from consistency over 90 days as:
- Google ranks you higher in local search results
- Prospects repeatedly see fresh evidence of your active business
- Your review count grows with our generation system
- Your content library builds momentum

Typical timeline:
- Month 1: Profile optimized, content system launching, first ranking improvements
- Month 2: Noticeable increase in calls and website clicks from Google Business Profile  
- Month 3+: Sustained growth as Google continues ranking you higher

**What if I don't have time to capture content?**

That's exactly why our system works. You spend just 10-20 minutes per week documenting work you're already doing. No editing required. No caption writing. No "what should I post?" stress.

We handle:
- All content planning (we tell you exactly what to capture and when)
- All editing and optimization  
- All caption writing
- All posting and scheduling
- All review management
- All strategy and analysis

You handle:
- Showing up to 15-minute strategy calls twice per month
- Capturing assigned content (10-20 minutes per week)
- That's it

**Important:** If you're too busy to document 10-20 minutes of weekly success, you're exactly who needs this system. But if you can't commit to this minimal capture requirement, we're not the right partner. The system requires authentic content from your actual operations.

**Can I upgrade from Winner to Dominator later?**

Absolutely. You can upgrade anytime to access all platforms and maximize your market advantage.

Most clients choose Dominator from the start for complete market domination:
- Google Business Profile (where prospects find you)
- Website (where they evaluate you)  
- Social media (where they confirm you're trustworthy)

But Winner provides a solid foundation if Google Business Profile is your priority and budget is a consideration.

**What's included in the Google Business Profile audit?**

We'll show you:

1. **Current Performance:**
   - Where you rank in Google Maps for your key services
   - How many calls/clicks/directions your profile generates
   - What prospects actually see when they find you

2. **Competitive Analysis:**
   - How your top 3 competitors compare
   - What they're doing that you're not
   - Specific advantages they have in Google's ranking algorithm

3. **Gap Analysis:**
   - Missing prominence signals (no recent content)
   - Relevance gaps (profile optimization issues)  
   - Trust gaps (review responses, outdated information)

4. **Opportunity Estimate:**
   - Projected increase in calls if gaps are fixed
   - Potential ranking improvements
   - Estimated revenue impact

**Do you work with businesses outside Ohio?**

Yes. Our system works nationwide because:
- Strategy calls are remote (Zoom/phone)
- You capture content at your location  
- We optimize your Google Business Profile remotely
- Content posts automatically wherever you're located

We serve local businesses across the United States. As long as you can commit to weekly content capture, location doesn't matter.

**What if I already have a website?**

Perfect. We'll optimize your existing website for:
- Google search (traditional SEO)
- AI search engines (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity)
- Trust and conversion when prospects click from Google Business Profile
- Mobile experience (critical for local search)

If your current website isn't salvageable or is outdated, we can build a new one optimized for the 4-minute decision window.

Winner package doesn't include website work but focuses exclusively on Google Business Profile. Dominator package includes complete website optimization or new build if needed.

**What makes your approach different from other marketing agencies?**

**We start where the 4-minute decision actually starts: Google Business Profile.**

Most agencies focus on:
- Social media followers (vanity metric)
- "Engagement" and likes (doesn't drive calls)  
- Pretty content that doesn't signal "active business" to Google
- Generic strategies that ignore Google's actual ranking algorithm

We focus on:
- Google Business Profile optimization (where prospects actually find you)
- Google's 3 ranking factors: relevance, distance, prominence
- Weekly content that signals "prominent active business" to the algorithm
- The actual trust sequence: GBP → Website → Social
- Metrics that matter: calls, clicks, rankings, revenue

**The critical difference:** We understand that prospects don't find you on Instagram. They find you on Google Maps when they search for your service. That's where we dominate.
