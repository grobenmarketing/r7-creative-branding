## Payment Terms
### During Trial Period
No payment is required during your 30-day trial period.

* * *
## Content & Editing Standards
### Platform Compliance Requirements
Google Business Profile has specific content requirements that we must follow:
*   Videos and photos cannot contain fancy transitions, motion effects, or excessive on-screen graphics
*   Text overlays on photos or videos are prohibited unless they describe something happening at the business location
*   Content must be authentic and representative of actual business operations
*   We will not be pushed to violate these platform guidelines, as doing so risks account penalties or removal
### Editing Style & Revision Policy
**Editing Focus:** We create content in informational/educational style with minimal transitions, color grading, and effects to match what performs well on these platforms
**One Round of Revisions:** You may request ONE minor revision per piece of content OR ONE revision to the caption (or complete caption rewrite)
**After Revisions:** Once requested revisions are completed, content will be published as final
**Iterative Improvement Process:** Content expectations and adjustments should be addressed in strategy sessions, not through endless editing rounds. We focus on consistent posting and improving content strategy over time, not perfectionism on individual pieces
* * *
## Limitation of Liability
**IMPORTANT:** Please read this section carefully
### Administrative Access and Reasonable Care
You acknowledge that R7 Creative's team will have administrative access to your social media accounts and Google Business Profile to perform the services outlined in this Agreement. R7 Creative maintains professional standards and follows platform best practices to protect your accounts. However, you understand that social media management involves inherent risks associated with platform access.
While we take every reasonable precaution, R7 Creative cannot guarantee against all technical errors, platform malfunctions, or unforeseen circumstances. By granting administrative access, you accept these inherent risks of digital services.
In the unlikely event of an error, R7 Creative will work promptly to correct the issue and minimize any impact. Our liability for such errors is limited as specified in the "Maximum Liability Cap" section below.
### Results and Expectations
R7 Creative is committed to following industry best practices and creating high-quality content aligned with platform guidelines. While our clients typically experience positive results (as described in "Results Our Clients Experience"), individual outcomes vary based on numerous factors including your industry, local competition, market conditions, and overall business operations. We cannot guarantee specific metrics such as phone calls, website clicks, or revenue increases, as these depend on variables beyond content creation alone.
### Maximum Liability Cap
In no event shall R7 Creative's total liability to you for any and all claims arising from or related to this Agreement exceed the total amount paid by you to R7 Creative in the one (1) month immediately preceding the claim. This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory upon which the claim is based. At R7 Creative's sole discretion, any liability may be satisfied through credit toward future services rather than monetary payment.
R7 Creative shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages including but not limited to lost profits, lost revenue, lost business opportunities, damage to reputation, or loss of data, even if R7 Creative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
* * *
## Platform Access and Account Security
### Administrative Access Required
You agree to provide R7 Creative with administrative login credentials for Google Business Profile and all social media platforms included in the selected service package. This access is necessary to perform content posting, engagement management, profile optimization, and analytics tracking.
### Account Ownership
You retain full ownership of all social media accounts and profiles. R7 Creative is granted access solely for the purpose of providing services under this Agreement. You may revoke access at any time, understanding that doing so will prevent R7 Creative from fulfilling service obligations.
### Security and Confidentiality
R7 Creative will maintain the confidentiality of all login credentials and will not share access with any third parties except as necessary to provide services. You are responsible for maintaining backup access to all accounts and for updating R7 Creative promptly if credentials change.
* * *
## Intellectual Property and Content Ownership
### Your Content Ownership
You retain ownership of all original content provided to R7 Creative including raw photos, videos, and brand materials.
### Edited Content and Captions
Upon full payment of fees, you own the final edited content and captions created by R7 Creative. R7 Creative retains the right to use your content in portfolio, case studies, marketing materials, and testimonials unless you specifically request otherwise in writing.
### Process and Systems
R7 Creative retains all rights to its proprietary processes, systems, workflows, templates, and methodologies including the "You Capture, We Create" system.
* * *
## Termination
### Termination for Convenience
Either party may terminate this Agreement with thirty (30) days written notice for any reason. Written notice must be sent via email to [hello@grobenmarketing.com](mailto:hello@grobenmarketing.com) or via certified mail to R7 Creative's business address.
### Termination for Cause
Either party may terminate immediately for cause upon written notice if the other party:
*   Materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure within ten (10) days of written notice
*   Engages in fraudulent or illegal activity
*   Files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent
### Effects of Termination
Upon termination, you must immediately pay all outstanding fees for services rendered through the termination date.
