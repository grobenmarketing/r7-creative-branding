## Executive Summary

R7 Creative transforms invisible local service businesses into visible, lead-generating machines through our proprietary "You Capture, We Create" system. We manage your digital pulse during the critical **4-minute decision window** when urgent customers decide who to call—ensuring you're one of the 2 businesses that get called instead of one of the 3 that get eliminated in browser tabs.

## The Six Brand Pillars

### 1. [[01-brand-positioning|Brand Positioning Statement]]

**Core Position:** "We Keep You in the 4-Minute Decision"

We don't "manage social media"—we manage your **digital pulse** during critical decision moments. Every day, potential customers spend exactly 4 minutes deciding who to call. They open 5 businesses, eliminate 3 based on dead profiles, and call only 2. **80% of businesses fail this test daily and never know it happened.**

**Key Points:**
- Digital Pulse Management vs. generic social media management
- 4-Minute Decision framework as core differentiation
- Competing against skepticism & failed attempts, not other agencies
- Target: $2-10M service businesses, 5-20 employees, plateaued at 1-2 calls/month

### 3. [[03-target-market|Target Market Definition]]

### 4. [[04-problem-solved|Problem Solved Statement]]

**Core Problem:** The 4-Minute Elimination

Local service businesses lose **$20-50K+ quarterly** because they're eliminated in 4 minutes by customers they never knew existed. The "Johns" of the world spend 4 minutes checking Google Business → Social → Website, eliminate 3 out of 5 businesses based on dead profiles, and call only 2.

**Four Problems We Solve:**
1. **Lost Opportunities:** 100 searches/month × 0 visibility = $50K-$300K lost annually
2. **Trust Deficit Tax:** 20-30% choose competitors due to inactive profiles
3. **Cascading Death Spiral:** Can't grow → can't hire → less time → fall further behind
4. **Skepticism Trap:** Tried marketing before, convinced "it doesn't work"

**Transformation Timeline:**
- **Weeks 2-4:** First "I found you on Google" call
- **Months 2-3:** 1-2 calls/month → 3-4 calls/week
- **Months 6-12:** Calendar booked 2-3 months out, hire staff

### 6. [[06-messaging-framework|Messaging Framework]]

**Core Message:** "We Keep You in the 4-Minute Decision"

Your next customer will decide on you in 4 minutes—not because of your quality, experience, or price, but because you looked active when they checked.

**Value Props by Persona:**
- **Skeptical:** "You don't need to be perfect. Just more present than the guy down the street."
- **Urgent:** "Right now, someone like John is deciding whether to call you or your competitor."
- **ROI-Focused:** "Every quarter of inconsistency costs $20-50K in lost deals."
- **Time-Crunched:** "You capture 10-15%. We handle 85-90%."
- **Overwhelmed:** "$550-950/month. Pays for itself in 2-3 months."

**Complete Framework Includes:**
- 6 key messages for every channel
- Objection handling scripts (7 common objections)
- Discovery call flow (opening → diagnostic → education → close)
- Email sequences (nurture, trial, post-trial)
- Elevator pitches (10-sec, 30-sec, 60-sec)
- Channel-specific guidance (social, web, sales, email)
- Taglines & headlines that convert
